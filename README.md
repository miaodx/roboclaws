> **Let's Bring Brain To Robots**

**Visible household-robot demos driven by MCP tools, reusable skills, and AI coding agents.**

Roboclaws is a thin demo repo for making AI-driven robotics behavior reviewable:
frames, maps, tool traces, scores, and public/private evaluation boundaries are
published as HTML reports instead of buried in terminal logs.

![Surface, intent, skill, and capability profile architecture](docs/human/mcp-skills-and-semantic-profiles.svg)

It answers three practical questions:

- How can an AI agent drive a robot?
- What context and tools does the agent need?
- What did the agent actually do in the simulated or robot-backed world?

## MCP and Skill Design Principles

Roboclaws treats reusable robot behavior as **skills first** and MCP tools as a
bounded public robot capability surface.

The short version:

- Public runs use `just run::surface` with `surface=...`, optional
  `preset=...`, and natural-language `prompt=...`.
- Skills own task strategy such as map-build, cleanup, and open household
  goals.
- MCP exposes bounded robot capabilities such as observe, navigate, pick,
  place, and done.
- Private evaluator truth stays out of agent inputs and public profile
  metadata.

The detailed profile and skill reference is
[docs/human/mcp-skills-and-semantic-profiles.md](docs/human/mcp-skills-and-semantic-profiles.md).

## Run Demos With Just

Install the project once:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

The `dev` extra includes the standard MolmoSpaces/MuJoCo CPU runtime used by
local cleanup demos. Isaac Lab is scoped to the B1 / Map 12 digital-twin route
and generic local runtime proof; keep it isolated in `.venv-isaaclab/` and do
not treat it as part of normal MolmoSpaces demos.

The public command grammar is named-parameter only. Public household launches
name the operator-facing surface, world or scene, backend runtime, optional task
preset, and agent engine separately:

```bash
just run::surface surface=<surface> agent_engine=<engine> [world=<world>] [backend=<backend>] [preset=<preset>] [prompt=<goal>] [key=value ...]
```

For full command routing, profiles, and maintainer-only recipes, read
[just/README.md](just/README.md).

To monitor and launch the supported local coding-agent household routes from a
standalone browser console, run:

```bash
just console::run
```

The console uses the same world/backend/preset/agent-engine catalog for local
coding-agent runs; it does not accept arbitrary browser-submitted shell
commands.
