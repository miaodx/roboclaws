# MolmoSpaces Settings Matrix

This is the operator-facing map for MolmoSpaces cleanup demo settings. Use it
to choose the right run shape before making project-status claims.

## Canonical Status Demo

For the current project-status artifact, prefer:

```text
contract=realworld_cleanup_v1
public_backend=mujoco
implementation_backend=molmospaces_subprocess
perception_mode=visible_object_detections
include_robot=true
record_robot_views=true
robot_name=rby1m
fixture_hint_mode=room_only
primitive_provenance=api_semantic
```

This produces a real MolmoSpaces/RBY1M cleanup report with Agent View, Private
Evaluation, Score, Semantic Substeps, and Robot View Timeline. The timeline
contains FPV, chase, map, and verification images when the backend can capture
robot views.

Current robot-view render defaults are intentionally conservative:
FPV/chase/verify/snapshot images render at `540 x 360`, while map images render
through a separate `620 x 420` report path. Do not raise the cleanup or RAW_FPV
default resolution casually: visual-grounding corpora, bbox coordinates,
latency, and image-token cost all depend on the frame size. Use the dedicated
renderer comparison path for visual A/B checks before changing defaults.

Do not use the synthetic dogfood kit as the main status artifact. It is useful
for fast contract checks, but it has no robot camera timeline.

## Main Axes

| Axis | Values | Meaning | Status Claim |
|------|--------|---------|--------------|
| Contract | `realworld_cleanup_v1` | ADR-0003 public/private-safe surface. No `scene_objects`, no target list. | Target contract for demos. |
| Backend | `api_semantic_synthetic` | Fast in-process semantic state mutation. | CI/smoke shape, not real visual proof. |
| Backend | `molmospaces_subprocess` | Real upstream MolmoSpaces/MuJoCo scene. | Required for real visual evidence. |
| Perception | `visible_object_detections` | Agent gets robot-local observed handles, categories, boxes, and support estimates. | Current best cleanup-success mode. |
| Perception | `raw_fpv_only` | Agent gets FPV observation artifact, no structured detections before declaration. | Camera evidence contract plus Model-Declared Observation cleanup path for image-capable agents. |
| Perception | `camera_model_policy` | Raw FPV observation first, then camera-derived candidates become observed handles. | Internal producer mode behind `evidence_lane=camera-grounded-labels`, using the shared Model-Declared Observation schema. |
| Visuals | `--include-robot --record-robot-views` | Capture RBY1M robot-view timeline. | Required for FPV/chase/map/verification report. |
| Visuals | omitted | No robot-view timeline. | Fast smoke only. |
| Map bundle | `assets/maps/molmospaces-procthor-val-0-7` | Selected prebuilt Nav2-shaped static map bundle. | Default for non-smoke Molmo cleanup lanes. |
| Map bundle | `map_bundle=<path-or-assets-id>` | Operator override for a prepared environment bundle. | Fails before cleanup startup if missing or invalid. |
| Fixture hints | `room_only` | Public room-level fixture hints. | Preferred ADR-0003 setting. |
| Fixture hints | `exact_fixtures` | Easier exact fixture hints. | Fallback/debug only. |
| Provenance | `api_semantic` | Cleanup tools mutate simulator semantic state. | Current normal cleanup loop. |
| Provenance | `planner_backed` | Cleanup subphase has matching RBY1M/CuRobo proof. | Future strict manipulation target. |

## Semantic Contract Profile

`household_world_v1` is the task-neutral MCP contract profile for household
world evidence. Cleanup skills compose it with `household_manipulation_v1` and
`household_episode_v1` when they need tools such as `navigate_to_object`,
`pick`, `place`, and `done`; the user's instruction, for example "clean the
room", remains a Task Prompt that the agent plans over those capabilities.

The profile is public-agent metadata only. It must not expose generated mess
sets, acceptable destinations, private manifests, hidden target lists,
`is_misplaced`, private scoring truth, or full simulator inventory oracles.
Demo recipes such as
`just run::surface surface=household-world intent=cleanup ...` choose a run
shape; they are not whole-task MCP tools.

## Model-Declared Camera Bridge

The Model-Declared Observation bridge lets a camera inference producer turn
public FPV evidence into public `observed_*` handles without exposing private
scoring truth. It applies to both camera evidence lanes:

| Evidence lane | Producer | Declaration timing |
|---------|----------|--------------------|
| `camera-raw-fpv` | Main cleanup agent reasoning over FPV image blocks. | Inline only: call `navigate_to_visual_candidate` when acting on a candidate. |
| `camera-grounded-labels` | Separate camera inference producer, detector, or deterministic harness producer selected by `camera_labeler`. | Producer registration: call `declare_visual_candidates` after an observation. |

`camera-raw-fpv` deliberately has no separate pre-registration strategy in normal
agent runs. That keeps the live image-agent loop close to the operator's mental
model: observe a raw camera frame, choose one plausible cleanup object, navigate
to it, then pick and place it. Explicit registration remains useful for
`camera-grounded-labels`, where perception and cleanup selection are separate roles.
In minimal-map `camera-raw-fpv`, omit `target_fixture_id`; use the
`candidate_fixture_id` and `recommended_tool` returned by
`navigate_to_visual_candidate`.

The declaration evidence should include source observation id, category, target
fixture id, evidence note, image region, producer metadata, grounding status,
and recovery hints. Unresolved declarations may appear in reports but should be
blocked from `pick`.

## Camera Labeler Axis

`evidence_lane=camera-grounded-labels` describes the input contract.
`camera_labeler` is the public producer axis. It is translated at the runner or
server boundary into the internal Visual Grounding Service pipeline id recorded
as report provenance.

| Camera labeler | Meaning | Implementation Status |
|----------|---------|-----------------------|
| `sim-projected-labels` | Deterministic simulator-state labels projected through camera visibility into reviewable camera candidates. | Current control producer. |
| `fake-http` | Contract-test HTTP service that returns deterministic public candidates. | First implementation phase. |
| `grounding-dino` | Bbox-first open-vocabulary proposer over RAW_FPV images. | Conservative first proposer target. |
| `yoloe` | YOLO-family promptable/open-vocabulary proposer over RAW_FPV images. | Proposer speed/latency comparison target. |
| `yolo-world` | YOLO-World open-vocabulary proposer over RAW_FPV images. | YOLO-family comparison target. |
| `omdet-turbo` | Transformers OmDet-Turbo open-vocabulary proposer over RAW_FPV images. | First-wave non-YOLO comparison target; current supported checkpoint is `omlab/omdet-turbo-swin-tiny-hf`. |
| `grounding-dino+mimo-v2.5` | Grounding DINO proposals refined by hosted MiMo v2.5 reasoning. | Refiner comparison target. |
| `yoloe+mimo-v2.5` | YOLOE proposals refined by hosted MiMo v2.5 reasoning. | Refiner comparison target. |
| `grounding-dino+qwen3-vl` | Grounding DINO proposals refined by Qwen3-VL. | Design target; optional until local access is proven. |
| `mimo-v2.5-direct` | Hosted VLM proposes candidates without a detector proposer. | Experimental direct-producer comparison. |
| `qwen3-vl-direct` | Qwen3-VL proposes candidates without a detector proposer. | Experimental and optional. |

Recommended command shape for the future pipeline comparison:

```bash
just run::surface surface=household-world world=molmospaces/val_0 backend=mujoco intent=cleanup agent_engine=direct-runner evidence_lane=camera-grounded-labels camera_labeler=sim-projected-labels
just run::surface surface=household-world world=molmospaces/val_0 backend=mujoco intent=cleanup agent_engine=direct-runner evidence_lane=camera-grounded-labels camera_labeler=fake-http
just run::surface surface=household-world world=molmospaces/val_0 backend=mujoco intent=cleanup agent_engine=direct-runner evidence_lane=camera-grounded-labels camera_labeler=grounding-dino
just run::surface surface=household-world world=molmospaces/val_0 backend=mujoco intent=cleanup agent_engine=direct-runner evidence_lane=camera-grounded-labels camera_labeler=yoloe
just run::surface surface=household-world world=molmospaces/val_0 backend=mujoco intent=cleanup agent_engine=direct-runner evidence_lane=camera-grounded-labels camera_labeler=omdet-turbo
just run::surface surface=household-world world=molmospaces/val_0 backend=mujoco intent=cleanup agent_engine=direct-runner evidence_lane=camera-grounded-labels camera_labeler=grounding-dino+mimo-v2.5
just run::surface surface=household-world world=molmospaces/val_0 backend=mujoco intent=cleanup agent_engine=direct-runner evidence_lane=camera-grounded-labels camera_labeler=yoloe+mimo-v2.5
```

`yolo-custom` is not an active pipeline. Without a planned cleanup-ontology
training set or supplied weights, it would only add dead configuration surface;
use `yoloe` or `yolo-world` for YOLO-family open-vocabulary probes.

For non-sim pipelines, Roboclaws should call an External Visual Grounding
Service behind `declare_visual_candidates`. The agent should not receive service
URLs, credentials, image filesystem paths, or model-host details. HTTP failures
must be recorded as pipeline failures; they must not silently fall back to
simulator labels unless `camera_labeler=sim-projected-labels` was selected.

`camera_labeler` is selected when launching the runner/server, not passed as a
cleanup MCP tool argument. The runner/server records the internal
`visual_grounding_pipeline_id` for service provenance. Agents should continue to call
`declare_visual_candidates(observation_id)` after `observe`; the server decides
whether empty candidate registration uses `sim` or the configured HTTP pipeline.
Explicit candidate declarations remain manual Model-Declared Observations and
should not trigger the external producer.

The first service request format should send JSON with base64 image bytes.
Shared filesystem image paths are allowed inside benchmark harness internals,
but not as the formal service contract. Use `VISUAL_GROUNDING_TIMEOUT_S`
defaulting to 20 seconds; inference timeouts should record pipeline failure
evidence rather than retrying. If `VISUAL_GROUNDING_API_KEY` is set, send it as
a bearer token and redact it from reports.

Keep model-heavy grounding code in sidecar service dependencies, not in the core
cleanup runtime. The repo may host the sidecar service code and fake pipeline,
but real Grounding DINO, YOLOE, Qwen3-VL, and hosted MiMo probes should be
explicit local/dev setup steps. Do not implicitly download model weights in
normal cleanup, benchmark, or CI recipes. Treat YOLOE/YOLO-family adapters as
optional probes until licensing and redistribution boundaries are reviewed.

The first implementation slice covers fake HTTP plumbing, shared client
injection, report/checker metadata, and direct/MCP-smoke evidence. Full real
proposer benchmarking remains a later hard gate. The configurable sidecar has
an explicit `--adapter-mode real` path for proposer probes, but operators must
install model dependencies and weights deliberately in the sidecar environment
before using it. Live Codex is a useful best-effort confidence check for that
slice, but direct and MCP-smoke fake HTTP runs are the hard gates.

Qwen3-VL and MiMo v2.5 should first be treated as refiners over detector
proposals. They can also be tested as direct producer replacements, but that is
a comparison mode rather than the first recommended path. Qwen3-VL should not
be a core cleanup dependency. A local Transformers/vLLM/SGLang probe is
acceptable when model access and memory are available, but Qwen3-VL should not
block the fake HTTP, proposer, or benchmark phases.

Before promoting a real pipeline to the end-to-end cleanup matrix, run a
perception-isolated visual-grounding benchmark over fixed RAW_FPV observations.
Benchmark command shape:

```bash
just agent::harness molmo-visual-grounding-benchmark pipeline=fake-http
just agent::harness molmo-visual-grounding-benchmark pipeline=grounding-dino,yoloe,yoloe+mimo-v2.5
just agent::harness molmo-visual-grounding-benchmark \
  matrix=harness/visual_grounding/first_wave_gpu_sidecar_matrix.json \
  corpus=harness/visual_grounding/local_raw_fpv_corpus.json \
  base_url=http://127.0.0.1:18880 \
  timeout_s=60
just agent::harness molmo-visual-grounding-benchmark pipeline=grounding-dino
just agent::harness molmo-visual-grounding-benchmark pipeline=yoloe
just agent::harness molmo-visual-grounding-benchmark pipeline=grounding-dino+mimo-v2.5
```

That benchmark should compare candidate recall, false positives, duplicate
rate, category-family accuracy, bbox/overlay quality, destination-hint quality,
actionability proxy rate, structured-output parse failures, latency, and cost
without running the full cleanup loop.
Cost and memory fields are explicit telemetry slots: they show reported totals
when a sidecar stage provides token/cost or memory metadata, and otherwise say
that the service did not report that data.
The benchmark result also emits a capped end-to-end probe recommendation:
always include the `sim` control, then at most one proposer-only pipeline, one
proposer-plus-refiner pipeline, and one direct VLM pipeline. Treat fake-contract
recommendations as artifact-shape evidence only until real stage provenance is
present for every selected non-sim pipeline; a mixed fake/real recommendation
still requires real reruns before promotion.
The benchmark checker treats zero candidates as a valid poor-recall result when
`--require-success` is used; add `--require-candidates` only for deterministic
fake smoke tests that are expected to emit at least one candidate.

Keep the benchmark working set under `harness/visual_grounding/`. The initial
git-tracked smoke corpus is synthetic and validates artifact shape only; larger
image corpora and generated outputs should remain local or published artifacts.
Private labels in that harness are scoring data only and must not be returned
to the agent or grounding service.

To build a path-backed corpus from a stored cleanup run with RAW_FPV artifacts:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/visual_grounding/build_visual_grounding_corpus_from_cleanup_run.py \
  output/molmo/<run>/seed-7 \
  --output harness/visual_grounding/local_raw_fpv_corpus.json
```

That single-run builder is automated, but it is intentionally narrow: it
exports one cleanup run's RAW_FPV observations. Use it for stable fixtures and
apple-to-apple reruns, not as the only evidence for model-family ranking.

For a more representative local benchmark corpus, generate a multi-run,
image-deduped sample from stored run artifacts:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/visual_grounding/build_representative_visual_grounding_corpus.py \
  output \
  --output output/visual-grounding-corpora/representative-raw-fpv/representative_raw_fpv_corpus.json \
  --name representative-raw-fpv \
  --max-observations 96 \
  --min-raw-fpv 5
```

The representative builder scans for `run_result.json` files with RAW_FPV
artifacts and private evaluation, drops exact duplicate image hashes by
default, stratifies by room/category labels, and records source/dedupe
statistics in `sampling`. Keep its output under ignored `output/` unless a
specific published artifact is needed.

For model selection, prefer a fresh bbox-labeled MolmoSpaces corpus generated
from multiple scene indices:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/visual_grounding/build_molmospaces_visual_grounding_bbox_corpus.py \
  --output output/visual-grounding-corpora/molmospaces-bbox-10x10/corpus.json \
  --name molmospaces-bbox-10x10 \
  --scene-source procthor-10k-val \
  --scene-indices 0-9 \
  --targets-per-scene 10 \
  --frame-classes target_focused_fpv
```

That builder actively creates MolmoSpaces scenes, focuses the robot FPV camera
on generated cleanup targets, and writes MuJoCo segmentation bbox truth as
private benchmark labels. Public requests still contain only the image, category
hints, fixture hints, and non-target capture provenance. Use `--scene-indices 0
--targets-per-scene 2` for a cheap local smoke before a 10x10 run.

That builder copies the referenced RAW_FPV images next to the generated corpus
and derives room-level private category-presence labels from the run's private
evaluation. When MolmoSpaces mess-placement diagnostics are available, the
builder assigns each private label to the public room containing the initial
mess receptacle fixture, then falls back to the legacy object-id room suffix
only when that fixture provenance is unavailable. Those labels are benchmark
scoring data only; they are not included in service requests, predictions JSONL,
MCP responses, or Agent View payloads.

Start the configurable sidecar service for CI-safe fake HTTP runs:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/visual_grounding/serve_visual_grounding_service.py --pipeline fake-http
```

For named contract pipelines without real model weights, run the fake
dispatcher:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/visual_grounding/serve_visual_grounding_service.py \
  --pipeline contract-fake
```

For real proposer probes, install optional sidecar dependencies and weights
explicitly into the dedicated sidecar environment, then run:

```bash
UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT="$PWD/.venv-visual-grounding" \
  uv sync --project sidecars/visual-grounding --extra cuda --extra yoloe --extra omdet

.venv-visual-grounding/bin/python - <<'PY'

  .venv-visual-grounding/bin/python scripts/visual_grounding/serve_visual_grounding_service.py \

```

The sidecar project intentionally does not change the core Roboclaws `.venv/`.
Use a local PyTorch CUDA index or mirror when needed; keep that machine-local
and out of committed project metadata.
Current default: DINO base recall (`IDEA-Research/grounding-dino-base`,
`box_threshold=0.25`, `text_threshold=0.20`). The older tiny-recall result came
from category-presence scoring on historical frames; the bbox-aware 2026-05-27
benchmark ranked base-recall first. Current OmDet support uses Transformers'
built-in `OmDetTurboProcessor` and `OmDetTurboForObjectDetection`; the
previously listed base checkpoint is not a valid public model id, so the
first-wave matrix sweeps the tiny checkpoint with threshold variants instead.

Hosted VLM refiner and direct-producer probes use an OpenAI-compatible
chat-completions endpoint from the sidecar. MiMo uses the existing hosted route
when `MIMO_TP_KEY` is present. Qwen3-VL should be configured explicitly through
a local or remote serving endpoint:

```bash
MIMO_TP_KEY=... \
  .venv/bin/python scripts/visual_grounding/serve_visual_grounding_service.py \
    --pipeline grounding-dino+mimo-v2.5 --adapter-mode real

VISUAL_GROUNDING_QWEN_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1 \
VISUAL_GROUNDING_QWEN_API_KEY=... \
  .venv/bin/python scripts/visual_grounding/serve_visual_grounding_service.py \
    --pipeline qwen3-vl-direct --adapter-mode real
```

For unauthenticated local test servers only, set
`VISUAL_GROUNDING_VLM_ALLOW_NO_API_KEY=true`. Do not use that setting for a
hosted provider.
Hosted VLM success artifacts should report `auth_mode=bearer_configured`,
provider/model/stage provenance, latency, and token or cost telemetry when the
provider returns it, while never writing bearer tokens or raw API keys to
benchmark results, predictions, traces, or reports.

List the sidecar adapter slots without starting the server:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/visual_grounding/serve_visual_grounding_service.py --list-adapters
```

The adapter catalog includes a redacted `runtime` readiness block for each
adapter. For local proposer adapters it reports importable dependencies such as
`torch`, `transformers`, and `ultralytics`; model weights remain unverified
until a real adapter run loads them. For hosted MiMo/Qwen routes it reports only
whether the endpoint/auth configuration is present and the resulting auth mode,
not raw keys or bearer tokens.

Real proposer pipeline ids such as `grounding-dino` and `yoloe` report visible
`adapter_unavailable`, `missing_dependency`, or adapter-error failures unless
the service is started with `--adapter-mode contract-fake` for contract tests or
`--adapter-mode real` with installed sidecar dependencies and model weights.
Hosted refiner and direct-producer ids such as `grounding-dino+mimo-v2.5`,
`mimo-v2.5-direct`, and `qwen3-vl-direct` report visible `missing_config`
failures until their endpoint and key/no-key local policy are configured. The
adapter catalog names the optional sidecar extra or provider configuration slot
for each target producer/refiner. The older `serve_fake_visual_grounding.py`
script remains a compatibility entry point for deterministic fake-only tests.
Fake outputs are pipeline-aware for contract tests only: they can emit proposer,
refiner, direct-producer, rejected-proposal, and overlay evidence for named
pipeline ids without claiming that real Grounding DINO, YOLOE, MiMo, or Qwen
weights were loaded.

For real-robot deployment, extend the same benchmark with a fixed head-camera
seed set and edge latency measurements before selecting a proposer. Route
perception is a later extension: candidates discovered during navigation should
carry `discovered_during=navigation`, use short-term tracking before becoming
stable handles, and never block navigation primitives.

Intermediate proposals, rejected proposals, and overlays are diagnostic
evidence. Benchmark reports may show them in detail; normal cleanup reports
should show accepted candidates, pipeline summary, failure evidence, and overlay
links. They must not become MCP response fields or Agent View cleanup
candidates. For live `camera-grounded-labels` agents, prompts should only
instruct the agent to call `declare_visual_candidates` after `observe`; they should not
mention service URLs, credentials, image paths, or model-host details.

For the first live `camera-raw-fpv` agent gate, prefer semantic acceptability over
the exact hidden restoration score: require enough preferred/acceptable
placements, full sweep coverage, declaration-driven actions, and no structured
label leakage. Keep the exact private scorer in the report as diagnostic
evidence and use it for stricter regression/debug runs when exact target
agreement is the point of the test.

## Entrypoint Support

Not every entrypoint exposes every contract mode yet. Treat the matrix below as
the current source of truth before claiming a run supports a setting.

| Entrypoint | Visible Detections | Raw FPV Only | Camera Labels | Notes |
|------------|--------------------|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| `python -m roboclaws.household.realworld_cleanup` | yes | yes | yes | Deterministic cleanup demo and checker path. The example path is only a thin wrapper. |
| `scripts/molmo_cleanup/run_molmo_realworld_agent_mcp_smoke.py` | yes | yes | yes | Dogfood/smoke wrapper used by several just recipes; uses model-declared simulated producers where camera-label declarations are exercised. |
| `python -m roboclaws.cli.agent_server household-world.cleanup` | yes | yes | yes | Direct Codex/Claude/OpenClaw server CLI exposes raw-FPV declaration tools and supports the `camera_model_policy` declaration path. |
| `RealWorldCleanupContract` / `realworld_mcp_server` internals | yes | yes | yes | Internals use `declare_visual_candidates` and `navigate_to_visual_candidate` for camera evidence to handle registration. |

## Command Taxonomy

Use `molmo::*` for daily operator commands. It names the run by driver and
profile:

```bash
just molmo::cleanup <driver> <profile>
```

| Axis | Values | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| Driver | `direct` | Deterministic Python cleanup loop; no MCP server and no live LLM agent. |
| Driver | `mcp-smoke` | Deterministic script through ADR-0003 MCP tools; drives the same tool-call path but does not launch Codex or Claude. |
| Driver | `openclaw-smoke` | OpenClaw policy-labeled MCP smoke; proves OpenClaw-shaped artifact/checker wiring but does not launch Gateway. |
| Driver | `codex-live` | Live Codex CLI connected to the cleanup MCP server. |
| Driver | `claude-live` | Live Claude Code connected to the cleanup MCP server. |
| Driver | `openclaw-live` | Live OpenClaw Gateway connected to the cleanup MCP server. |
| Preset | `smoke` | Synthetic contract sanity; world labels; semantic report. |
| Evidence lane | `world-oracle-labels` | MolmoSpaces/RBY1M report; agent receives privileged structured world labels as semantic candidates, then must confirm source-FPV evidence before navigation. |
| Evidence lane | `world-public-labels` | MolmoSpaces/RBY1M report; agent receives structured detections without destination/tool oracle hints or pre-confirmed navigation authorization. |
| Evidence lane | `camera-raw-fpv` | MolmoSpaces/RBY1M report; agent receives raw camera artifacts and no structured labels. |
| Evidence lane | `camera-grounded-labels` | MolmoSpaces/RBY1M report; agent receives camera-derived structured candidates produced by `camera_labeler`. |

`verify::*` remains the confidence-gate namespace: it runs focused tests and then
delegates scenario execution to `harness::*`. `harness::*` remains the
lower-level implementation-rig namespace, useful when debugging a specific
script or checker. Prefer `molmo::*` when deciding what report to produce.
Non-smoke cleanup profiles require a selected prebuilt Nav2 map bundle; the
facade defaults to `assets/maps/molmospaces-procthor-val-0-7`, and `map_bundle=...`
accepts either a path or an environment id under `assets/maps`.

Convenience report recipes:

| Command | Expands To | Use It For |
|---------|------------|------------|
| `just molmo::quick-check` | `mcp-smoke smoke` | Cheap contract check; accepts `driver=` and `profile=` overrides. |
| `just molmo::review-report` | `direct world-oracle-labels` | Canonical human review/status report. |
| `just molmo::mcp-smoke-report` | `mcp-smoke world-oracle-labels` | Real visual MCP smoke without a live external agent. |
| `just molmo::openclaw-smoke-report` | `openclaw-smoke world-oracle-labels` | OpenClaw-labeled visual artifact without live Gateway. |
| `just molmo::camera-raw-report` | `direct camera-raw-fpv` | Camera-only observation evidence; not cleanup-success proof. |
| `just molmo::codex-report` | `codex-live world-oracle-labels` | Live Codex agent report. |
| `just molmo::claude-report` | `claude-live world-oracle-labels` | Live Claude Code agent report. |
| `just molmo::openclaw-report` | `openclaw-live world-oracle-labels` | Live OpenClaw Gateway report. |

For live Codex / Claude reports, repo-local `.env` keys are honored the same
way as the direct navigation demos. Normal users configure keys only; command
shape controls behavior.

```bash
XM_LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.llm.mioffice.cn/v1
XM_LLM_ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.llm.mioffice.cn/anthropic  # optional
XM_LLM_API_KEY=...
MIMO_TP_KEY=...
KIMI_API_KEY=...
```

Codex repo workflows default to `codex-env` and require `CODEX_BASE_URL` plus
`CODEX_API_KEY` (`gpt-5.5`, Responses API). They do not fall back to mify when
`XM_LLM_API_KEY` is present. To use mify, set `ROBOCLAWS_CODEX_PROVIDER=mify`
explicitly; that profile uses `XM_LLM_API_KEY`, `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5`, Responses
API, and web search disabled. Claude Code prefers MiMo when
`MIMO_TP_KEY` is present, then Kimi when `KIMI_API_KEY` is present, then mify
Anthropic when `XM_LLM_API_KEY` is present. Bare system CLIs are outside the
supported path unless a human explicitly asks for a debugging run. Before a
long Codex visual cleanup run, use:

```bash
just code::codex-provider-smoke
```

Local public live-agent recipes support Codex and Claude Code only through the
pinned coding-agent Docker toolchain and repo-local `.env`. Hosted CI does not
support Codex, but may run supported Claude Code and OpenClaw routes. Use the
same key set when comparing Kimi/MiMo results across machines:

```bash
just run::surface surface=household-world world=molmospaces/val_0 backend=mujoco intent=cleanup agent_engine=claude-code provider_profile=mimo-anthropic evidence_lane=world-oracle-labels seed=7 scenario_setup=relocate-cleanup-related-objects relocation_count=5
```

Default CLI pins are recorded in `scripts/dev/coding_agent_toolchain.env`.
Docker-backed Codex runs use repo-local `.env` credentials; host `~/.codex`
auth/config is not copied into repo workflows.

`codex-live` is detached by default. `just molmo::codex-report` starts a tmux
session that owns the cleanup MCP server, `codex exec`, logs, checker, and
artifacts, then returns with status/attach/tail commands. Probe it without
attaching:

```bash
just molmo::status
just molmo::status output/molmo/codex-report/<stamp>/seed-7
```

The status probe reports tmux liveness, elapsed time, MCP tool progress,
`run_result.json` / `report.html` readiness, and the latest Codex message if
the CLI has written one. Interactive/operator MolmoSpaces visual cleanup remains
single-instance by default because each visual run owns a MuJoCo-backed
MolmoSpaces backend. If an interactive Codex tmux session is active or the
requested MCP port is busy, the launcher fails instead of silently starting
another simulator on a different port.

Adaptive validation matrix runs may select multiple visual cleanup rows:

```

The matrix records relevant rows and reports local runtime blockers honestly.
Live Codex Molmo cleanup remains single-session by launcher policy; if one row
is active, later live Codex rows are blocked rather than moved to a hidden port
or silently replaced by a cheaper substitute.

For quick axis overrides, use positional values or `driver=` / `profile=`
prefixes:

```bash
just molmo::quick-check openclaw-smoke smoke
just molmo::quick-check driver=openclaw-smoke profile=smoke
```

## Report Shapes

All Molmo cleanup demos should route through the shared cleanup report underlay
in `roboclaws/household/report.py`. Different settings only add or omit
sections.

| Shape | Required Settings | Expected Sections |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Synthetic cleanup smoke | `api_semantic_synthetic` | Summary, before/after, semantic substeps, score, advisory/private sections where available. No robot timeline. |
| Real visual cleanup | `molmospaces_subprocess`, `include_robot`, `record_robot_views` | Synthetic sections plus Robot View Timeline with FPV, top-down scene view, and verification. Semantic Map is rendered separately from public map/runtime evidence. |
| Raw FPV evidence | `perception_mode=raw_fpv_only`, robot views enabled | Raw FPV Observations plus visual timeline. No structured observed-object table before declaration. |
| Sanitized detector evidence | `evidence_lane=world-public-labels` | Structured detections with producer/source/actionability fields. Destination, tool selection, and navigation authorization remain policy-required until source-FPV confirmation. |
| Model-declared camera cleanup | `camera-raw-fpv` or `camera-grounded-labels` with declaration evidence | Raw FPV Observations plus Model-Declared Observations and normal semantic cleanup sections. |
| Camera-label producer evidence | `evidence_lane=camera-grounded-labels` or `perception_mode=camera_model_policy` | Raw FPV observation evidence plus Model-Declared Observations with camera-labeler and internal visual-grounding pipeline provenance. |
| Planner proof attached | `--planner-proof-run-result ...` | Attached Planner Proof, Cleanup Primitive Gate, Planner Cleanup Bridge. |
| Proof bundle runner | proof-bundle runner script | Separate runner report with selected commands, proof results, blockers, grasp/task-feasibility evidence. |

## Recommended Recipes

Molmo operator recipes write runs under Shanghai-local timestamp folders:
`output/molmo/<recipe>/<MMDD_HHMM>/...`. Recipes place each seed below that
timestamp root, for example `output/molmo/review-report/0511_1628/seed-1/`.

Fast synthetic contract smoke:

```bash
just molmo::quick-check
```

Real visual status/review report:

```bash
just molmo::review-report
```

Renderer-only standard-vs-Filament comparison:

```bash
just molmo::renderer-comparison
just molmo::renderer-comparison 7 10 output/molmo/renderer-comparison-1280x720 procthor-10k-val 0 rby1m 8 1280 720
```

The comparison recipe is positional. When overriding render width or height,
also pass the intermediate scene, robot, and focus-count arguments so values do
not shift into earlier slots. The high-resolution path changes only comparison
artifacts; it does not change cleanup, RAW_FPV, or visual-grounding defaults.

Render-only MuJoCo/Isaac scene camera comparison:

```bash
just molmo::scene-camera-comparison
```

Add the opt-in Genesis candidate lane when reviewing Genesis visual parity:

```bash
ROBOCLAWS_GENESIS_PYTHON=.venv-genesis/bin/python \
  just molmo::scene-camera-comparison genesis=on \
  scene_usd_path=output/isaaclab/flattened-semantic-usd/0604_val1_mujoco_body_pose_fix/scene_semantic.usda
```

This probe uses `roboclaws.camera_control.render_views` to drive MuJoCo, a
prepared Isaac USD, and optionally Genesis with one external camera request. It
is for scene/camera review only: it does not run cleanup, pick/place, private
scoring, or pickup box annotation. The main lane now uses explicit canonical
`eye`/`target`/`up` poses in the MolmoSpaces scene frame for both backends.
Room-level views use MolmoSpaces room mesh world bounds, not MuJoCo mesh
`geom_size`, so the room camera starts from a real room scale. The report also
records camera-pose, camera-intrinsics, room-scale, lighting, color profile,
and USD-bounds residuals separately. MuJoCo canonical views convert the explicit
`eye`/`target` request into MuJoCo's free-camera azimuth/elevation convention
before rendering; the manifest records the backend pose used for the parity
check. The camera request also carries MuJoCo runtime render state separately
from legacy object-center positions, including articulated child joint names
and `qpos` values when MolmoSpaces exposes them. Genesis movable-object
diagnostics treat translation-only object overlays as insufficient for
articulated objects such as box flaps and report unsupported articulation
instead of a false `runtime_pose_match`; when the prepared USD summary proves
MuJoCo visual joint endpoint-pose baking and frozen visual physics, the report
classifies those objects as `articulated_static_baked_match`. Isaac uses the
prepared USD's scene lights plus the configured soft fill profile and reports
both existing and added light counts. Target-vs-USD
diagnostics are bounds-aware: large receptacles may aim the camera above a
surface, so the report treats a target inside the USD XY footprint and within
the configured surface-aim height allowance separately from a true target/scene
frame mismatch. A passing camera-pose contract means the two backends accepted
the same render-camera API pose; material differences, renderer lighting, or
display color-management differences can still prevent full visual identity.
The Genesis lane is render-only evidence: when native USD stage import fails on
the prepared mixed physics graph, it uses a material-preserving OBJ/MTL visual
package fallback and reports that import mode in the manifest.

Real visual MCP smoke:

```bash
just molmo::mcp-smoke-report
```

Real visual OpenClaw-shaped smoke:

```bash
just molmo::openclaw-smoke-report
```

Raw camera evidence:

```bash
just molmo::camera-raw-report
```

Live external-agent reports:

```bash
just molmo::codex-report
just molmo::claude-report
just molmo::openclaw-report
```

`openclaw-report` keeps the repo work-network guard. `claude-report` is blocked
on the work network unless the repo-local `.env` contains a supported MiMo,
Kimi, or mify Anthropic key route. `codex-report` may run on the work network
with the repo-local `codex-env` route configured in `.env`, or with explicit
`ROBOCLAWS_CODEX_PROVIDER=mify` plus `XM_LLM_API_KEY`. Run
`just dev::network-status` first if you are unsure which network you are on.

Planner proof-bundle dry run:

```bash
just harness::molmo-planner-proof-bundle-runner
```

Local strict proof/rerun attempt:

```bash
just harness::molmo-planner-proof-bundle-execute-rerun
```

## Current Boundaries

- A clean semantic cleanup run does not prove physical manipulation.
- `api_semantic` means the simulator state was updated through semantic tools.
- `raw_fpv_only` proves camera artifact plumbing and, for image-capable agents,
  the Model-Declared Observation cleanup path from FPV evidence to public
  handles.
- The `camera-raw-fpv` live success gate uses semantic acceptability because a tidy
  camera-derived placement can be correct for review while missing the generated
  exact target fixture.
- The 2026-06-08 scorer-only raw-FPV probe reached a scoreable 36-frame
  raw-only set covering all five generated targets, but CodexENV `gpt-5.5`
  still confirmed at most two unique coarse hidden targets. Keep pure
  `camera-raw-fpv` as a baseline/ablation lane and prefer
  `camera-grounded-labels` for the current live cleanup path. That conclusion is
  scoped to hidden-target recovery and live actionability; a clean-context
  RAW-FPV visual labeler is tracked separately as perception-only evidence.
- `camera_model_policy` remains internal metadata for deterministic simulated
  camera-label producer evidence under the shared Model-Declared Observation
  schema; it is not real VLM pixel inference unless the producer is explicitly a
  VLM/detector route.
- The global planner cleanup bridge remains blocked until cleanup subphases are
  planner-backed for the required object/target bindings.
- OpenClaw minimum viability and clean cleanup success are separate gates.
