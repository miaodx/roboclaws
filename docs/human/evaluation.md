# Evaluation Harness And Suites

Roboclaws uses four related but separate proof layers:

| Layer | Command shape | Owns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product run | `just run::surface ...` | One operator-facing run with prompt, surface, world, backend, agent engine, evidence lane, artifacts, and report. |
| Eval harness | `just agent::eval recommend|execute ...` | Diff- or plan-aware orchestration across deterministic gates, product rows, eval suites, live-agent evals, blocked evidence, and regression-promotion guidance. |
| Eval suite | `just agent::eval suite=<suite> ...` | Versioned capability benchmark across samples, trials, graders, aggregate metrics, and failure replay. |
| Harness recipe | `harness::*` or lower private recipes | Specialist execution mechanics used by product runs and eval flows. |

The maintained user-facing skill is `@eval-harness`. The old separate
`agent-validation-matrix` route is retired; historical evidence may still link
to it, but active plan/diff validation should use `just agent::eval
recommend|execute`.

An eval suite answers whether a capability is improving over time, not whether a
single demo happened to complete. The expected flow is:

```text
eval_suite
  -> eval_sample
  -> environment reset
  -> agent trial
  -> trace and artifacts
  -> deterministic and optional advisory graders
  -> aggregate metrics
  -> failure replay or regression sample
```

Initial household graders should cover artifacts, final state/outcome,
trajectory, privacy, and efficiency. Deterministic privacy and safety failures
are authoritative; model or human rubric graders are advisory until calibrated.

Eval results must record enough identity to compare runs: suite/sample/trial,
surface, intent, preset, world, backend, evidence lane, camera labeler, scenario
setup, seed, prompt or goal hash, agent engine, provider/model, skill source,
MCP profile/tool surface, runtime limits, budgets, and artifact schema versions.
Missing relevant fields should be explicit `unavailable` or `not_applicable`.

The current repo-native schema package is `roboclaws.evals`. Versioned suite and
sample definitions live under `evals/<capability>/`, starting with
`evals/household_world/`.

The deterministic runner is available through:

```bash
just agent::eval recommend plan=docs/plans/example.md budget=focused
just agent::eval execute since=origin/main budget=focused
just agent::eval suite=smoke_regression budget=smoke
just agent::eval suite=map_build_consumer budget=smoke
just agent::eval suite=cleanup_capability budget=smoke
just agent::eval suite=scene_sampler_stress budget=smoke
```

These suites run direct-runner household samples without provider keys, write
`output/evals/<suite>/<stamp>/eval_results.json`, and render
`eval_report.html` with links to the underlying product run artifacts. Smoke
budget uses the synthetic cleanup backend for local determinism while eval
identity still records the sample's public surface, world, backend, evidence
lane, and missing live-provider fields explicitly.

`cleanup_capability` records repeated cleanup trials and reports `pass@k` plus
`pass^k` aggregate metrics. Live-agent eval identity can be requested with
`agent_engine=... provider_profile=...`; by default those trials are recorded
as blocked identity/preflight packets so provider-backed work is not launched
by accident. Use `live_execution=run` only when you intend to run the selected
live provider route. The live bridge calls the public `run::surface` product
route, pins an eval-owned `run_dir`, discovers timestamped product artifacts
when needed, and grades the SDK product artifacts written under that run dir:

```bash
just agent::eval suite=cleanup_capability budget=smoke \
  agent_engine=openai-agents-sdk provider_profile=codex-router-responses \
  live_execution=run live_timeout_s=120
```

The eval result records blocked provider/runtime conditions separately from
agent behavior when the selected live route cannot finish.

Completed live eval artifacts can be regraded after grader changes without
launching a provider route:

```bash
just agent::eval suite=map_build_consumer budget=focused \
  agent_engine=openai-agents-sdk provider_profile=codex-router-responses \
  regrade_source=output/evals/<suite>/<stamp>
```

MapBuild review can also be rendered as a cross-run matrix report after running
multiple providers or settings:

```bash
just agent::eval map-build-report \
  eval_results=output/evals/<suite>/<stamp>/eval_results.json,output/evals/<suite>/<other-stamp>/eval_results.json \
  output_dir=output/evals/map-build-matrix-review
```

`eval_results=` accepts comma-separated files or directories. Directories are
searched for `eval_results.json`. The command writes
`map_build_matrix_report.html` and `map_build_matrix_summary.json`; the report
compares MapBuild quality, runtime-map enrichment over the Base Metric Map,
downstream open-ended and cleanup deltas between tasks run without the MapBuild
prior and with the fixture-focused MapBuild prior, wall time, model attempts,
and MCP/tool request counts. It uses only eval artifacts and grader outputs;
private fixture/scorer truth remains grader-only and is not converted into
runtime or agent-facing map input.

`scene_sampler_stress` is the static eval projection for source-aware
MolmoSpaces scene sampling. It currently admits six prepared
`procthor-10k-val` map-build samples and ten prepared `procthor-objaverse-val`
map-build samples; `procthor-10k-val` remains a partial source until more rows
clear the scanner gates.
Sampler selection uses a deterministic seeded-random policy that is scoped per
`scene_source` and prefers different public room counts before filling remaining
slots, so UI/eval rows do not depend on a single contiguous scene-index range.
`ithor` and `holodeck-objaverse-val` remain in the projection as rejected
exhausted source metadata because their candidate evidence fails the current
public-room/actionability gates. Its `sampler_admission` grader checks the
sampler metadata carried by each sample: split-qualified `scene_source`, scene
index, readiness status, room/navigation-area count, waypoint count,
room-category provenance, selected reason, generator version, and
blocked/rejected projection metadata. The grader is deterministic and must not
call live providers.

Scene catalog changes are synchronized through a deterministic guard:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/operator_console/check_scene_catalog_sync.py
```

Run it after changing MolmoSpaces candidate indices, committed map bundles,
room-label manifests, preview assets, or scene-sampler admission logic. It
regenerates the scene-sampler eval suite and samples in a temporary directory,
diffs them against committed fixtures, and checks that every operator-console
MolmoSpaces world has the expected preview coverage. It does not rewrite
`cleanup_capability`, `map_build_consumer`, `open_ended_goals`, or their
household samples unless the scenario contract for those suites changes too.

Sampler readiness exports include a separate
`scene_sampler_candidate_profile.json` for metadata-first curation across all
four scene groups. The profile can recommend new source-scoped candidate ids for
`ithor` and `holodeck-objaverse-val`, but it has no admission effect: a scene
still enters `scene_sampler_stress` only after the normal scanner gates pass.

Blocked live-agent packets include either `roboclaws_live_eval_preflight_v1`
runner metadata, or a live product-route failure classified separately from
agent behavior failures. Provider 5xx/429/model-service failures are
`model_or_provider_unavailable`; missing simulator/runtime dependencies are
`environment_blocked`.

Failed, blocked, or inconclusive eval results can be promoted into a durable
regression sample with:

```bash
just agent::eval promote-regression \
  eval_results=output/evals/<suite>/<stamp>/eval_results.json \
  source_sample_id=<sample-id> \
  regression_sample_id=regression.<name>
```

By default this writes a sample under `evals/household_world/samples/regressions/`
and updates the source suite manifest. Use `sample_output_path=...` and
`suite_output_path=...` for dry runs or review-local promotion artifacts. Human
review labels are `eval-regression:accepted`,
`eval-regression:needs-human-review`, and `eval-regression:do-not-promote`; the
last label is a stop label and will not write a sample.

Keep private scorer truth private. Generated mess sets, acceptable destinations,
hidden target lists, and private manifests may feed graders and reports, but
they must not appear in agent-facing MCP inputs or capability profile metadata.
Eval-harness manifests may link maintainer-only private artifacts, but must not
inline that private truth.
Cleanup evals should classify a live `static_fixture_projection` MCP call as a trajectory
violation while allowing historical artifact fields with the same name to remain
readable for reports and map-bundle compatibility. Regression promotion records
source result links and human labels inside `private_goal_reference` with
`private_truth_scope=grader_only`; that reference is grader input, not agent
input.
