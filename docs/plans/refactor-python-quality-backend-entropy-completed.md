# Completed Ledger: Python Quality And Backend Entropy

## Purpose

This is the only completed-work ledger for the Python quality/backend entropy
stream. Keep it compact so future agents do not need to read old execution
logs before choosing the next slice.

## Ledger Rules

- One completed slice or bundle per bullet.
- Keep each entry to the durable effect, proof class, and metric delta when it
  matters.
- Do not paste full command output or full test command lists.
- If this ledger gets bulky, compress older rows in place. Do not create a
  third related document.

## Metric Story

- Start of loop on 2026-06-14: 217 Ruff complexity violations and 61 oversized
  modules.
- Paused checkpoint on 2026-06-15 dirty worktree: 19 Ruff complexity violations
  and 56 oversized modules.
- Interpretation: control-flow complexity dropped sharply; oversized count
  moves slowly because large files can shrink materially and still remain above
  the 800-line ratchet threshold.

## Completed Bundles

- 2026-06-14: Backend facade started. `CleanupBackendSession` gained backend
  id/runtime-artifact attachment, shared backend construction, and common
  direct/MCP metadata attachment. Proof: focused backend/MCP tests and ratchet.

- 2026-06-14: Ratchet summary mode added. The quality gate can now report top
  oversized modules, high complexity entries, and complexity by file without
  changing default CI output. Proof: ratchet unit tests and ratchet gate.

- 2026-06-14: Shared worker runner extracted for MolmoSpaces/Isaac one-shot
  subprocesses. Persistent Molmo worker behavior stayed Molmo-specific. Proof:
  worker/backend unit tests and ratchet.

- 2026-06-14: Live cleanup checker split into staged assertion families, with
  Isaac runtime and semantic-pose checks moved to focused helpers. Metric:
  complexity baseline 217 -> 211.

- 2026-06-14: Direct cleanup artifact/result assembly moved to
  `realworld_run_artifacts.py`. `run_realworld_cleanup` became more staged and
  dropped substantially in size/complexity.

- 2026-06-14: Live MCP `done` finalization moved to
  `realworld_mcp_run_artifacts.py`, sharing backend metadata attachment instead
  of local backend-name/runtime wrappers. Metric: 211 -> 210.

- 2026-06-14: `RealWorldCleanupContract` constructor setup moved into
  `realworld_contract_init.py`; runtime-map and cleanup-worklist payloads moved
  into `realworld_contract_payloads.py`. Metric: 210 -> 209.

- 2026-06-14: Optional backend capabilities moved behind the backend facade:
  snapshots, robot views, close/final locations, and requested run size. This
  reduced repeated backend probing in direct cleanup and live MCP paths.

- 2026-06-14: Report sections started moving out of `report.py` into focused
  section modules for maps, timing, action evidence, grasp cache, proof bundle,
  agent/runtime-map, robot-view, and planner proof content.

- 2026-06-14: Planner-proof checker/probe, map-bundle validation, actionable
  snapshot, Isaac worker helper families, scene-camera helpers, visual-parity
  diagnostics, and RAW-FPV scoring each received targeted complexity splits.

- 2026-06-14: OpenAI Agents live runtime/budget/metrics helpers removed
  grouped production complexity from the OpenAI live runner and SDK driver
  surfaces, while keeping provider behavior mocked in default proof.

- 2026-06-15: Shared household live-runner helpers centralized CLI args,
  backend leasing, checker-gate filtering, and OpenAI metric readers across
  Codex, Claude Code, and OpenAI Agents SDK cleanup runners.

- 2026-06-15: Several focused production residuals were split without changing
  public schemas: semantic timeline, grasp cache blockers, map-bundle waypoint
  projection, physical Nav2 pilot phases, visual-candidate declaration, and
  Agibot rehearsal helpers.

- 2026-06-15: Test complexity cleanup began for live-runtime perf/profile
  tests, coding-agent Docker toolchain checks, public/private artifact
  contracts, fake Isaac backend assertions, and operator-console static assets.

- 2026-06-15: Dirty-worktree cleanup removed current ratchet blockers from
  model-matrix, operator-console, Agibot identity/readiness, report evidence
  badges, and MCP smoke artifact assertions without blessing unrelated parallel
  changes into the baseline.

- 2026-06-15: Pause checkpoint committed only the operator-console static asset
  test cleanup. Ratchet passed at 19 Ruff complexity violations and 56
  oversized modules; remaining work returned to the active plan.

- 2026-06-15: Scene-sampler scanner evidence/admission helpers moved into
  `scene_sampler_scanner.py`, removing production complexity rows from
  `scene_sampler.py`. Metric: dirty resumed checkpoint 28 -> 25 complexity
  rows; oversized modules stayed at 60. Proof: focused scene-sampler tests,
  ruff, format check, and ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Scene-sampler source-selection metadata moved into
  `scene_sampler_sources.py` while admitting the `procthor-objaverse-val`
  sampler rows and fixtures. Metric: `scene_sampler.py` is down to 2432 lines
  but remains a P1 hard-ceiling candidate. Proof: focused scene-sampler/eval
  tests, ruff, format check, and ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Scene-sampler readiness-export artifact assertions moved behind
  focused local helpers, removing that operator-console test from the ratchet
  complexity list. Current ratchet still shows 25 complexity rows and 62
  oversized modules, led next by `export_scene_sampler_readiness.py`,
  `scene_sampler.py`, and one launch test. Proof: focused scene-sampler/eval
  tests, ruff, format check, and ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Scene-sampler readiness export script split payload construction,
  artifact writes, generated eval emission, summary assembly, and threshold
  checks into focused helpers. Metric: 25 -> 21 complexity rows; oversized
  modules unchanged at 62. Proof: focused scene-sampler/eval tests, ruff,
  format check, and ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Scene-sampler projection launch test split source-specific
  assertions into focused helpers, removing the last scene-sampler test row
  from the complexity list. Metric: 21 -> 20 complexity rows; oversized modules
  unchanged at 62. Proof: focused scene-sampler/eval tests, ruff, format check,
  and ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Scene-sampler source prep and availability helpers moved into
  `scene_sampler_prep.py`, keeping `scene_sampler.py` as the public sampler
  facade. Metric: `scene_sampler.py` 2457 -> 1975 lines and no longer above the
  2000-line hard ceiling; ratchet remains 20 complexity rows and 62 oversized
  modules. Proof: focused scene-sampler/eval tests, ruff, format check, and
  ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Planner proof bundle runner report assertions moved behind
  focused HTML helper families while preserving rendered report coverage.
  Metric: 20 -> 19 complexity rows; oversized modules unchanged at 62. Proof:
  focused report test, ruff, format check, and ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Fake Isaac backend protocol test split runtime, scene-binding,
  visual-artifact, semantic-pose, and robot-import checks into focused local
  helpers. Metric: 19 -> 18 complexity rows; oversized modules unchanged at 62.
  Proof: focused Isaac backend test, ruff, format check, and ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Scene-camera comparison report contract test split fixture-image
  setup, review UI, contract-section, lighting/render-domain, and lane-image
  assertions into focused helpers. Metric: 18 -> 17 complexity rows; oversized
  modules unchanged at 62. Proof: focused scene-camera report test, ruff,
  format check, and ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Planner manipulation probe report assertions moved into focused
  overview, cleanup-binding, sampler-failure, and runtime-diagnostics helper
  families. Metric: removed the `93>50` report row; dirty worktree ratchet
  stayed at 17 because unrelated scene-sampler readiness edits introduced a
  new `52>50` helper row. Proof: focused report test, ruff, format check, and
  ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Real Isaac worker semantic-pose recapture test split runtime
  setup, capture hooks, worker commands, result assertions, and persisted-state
  assertions into focused helpers. Metric: dirty worktree ratchet 17 -> 15
  complexity rows; oversized modules unchanged at 62. Proof: focused Isaac
  backend test, ruff, format check, and ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Minimal-map privacy/generated-candidate contract test split
  first-observation lookup, static-map privacy checks, target-candidate search
  checks, public-anchor checks, and observed-object anchor checks into focused
  helpers. Metric: 15 -> 14 complexity rows; oversized modules unchanged at
  62. Proof: focused realworld-contract test, ruff, format check, and ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Nav2-shaped public map/provenance contract test split detection
  lookup, confirmation/pick/navigation flow, map-shape assertions, navigation
  provenance assertions, and runtime-map assertions into focused helpers.
  Metric: 14 -> 13 complexity rows; oversized modules unchanged at 62. Proof:
  focused realworld-contract test, ruff, format check, and ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Robot visual timeline report test split render-context setup,
  robot-view step builders, layout/lightbox/semantic-substep/pose/caveat
  assertions, and yaw-rendering proof into focused helpers. Metric: 13 -> 12
  complexity rows; oversized modules unchanged at 62. Proof: focused report
  test, ruff, format check, and ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Robot-camera object parity audit test split fixture files/state,
  audit assertions, render-parity diagnostics assertions, and report assertions
  into focused helpers. Metric: 12 -> 11 complexity rows; oversized modules
  unchanged at 62. Proof: focused apple-to-apple test, ruff, format check, and
  ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Robot-camera render-contract diagnostics test split light/shadow
  fixtures, scene-binding diagnostics, summary checks, material response checks,
  preview-surface checks, and tone/location assertions into focused helpers.
  Metric: 11 -> 10 complexity rows; oversized modules unchanged at 62. Proof:
  focused apple-to-apple test, ruff, format check, and ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Agibot semantic map-build MCP contract test split tool-response,
  run-identity, policy-trace, runtime-map, and artifact/report assertions into
  focused helpers. Metric: 10 -> 9 complexity rows; oversized modules unchanged
  at 62. Proof: focused physical Agibot pilot test, ruff, format check, and
  ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Isaac semantic-pose stage tests now share fake USD stage, parent
  transform, translate-op, PXR install, and semantic-pose state helpers instead
  of redefining nested fake classes per case. Metric: 9 -> 7 complexity rows;
  oversized modules unchanged at 62. Proof: focused Isaac backend tests, ruff,
  format check, and ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Isaac head-camera robot-pose test moved fake robot prim/stage,
  PXR install, head-camera xform ops, and shared robot-pose state into focused
  helpers. Metric: 7 -> 6 complexity rows; oversized modules unchanged at 62.
  Proof: focused Isaac backend test, ruff, format check, and ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Isaac scene-camera color-profile test moved fake sim, sim-utils,
  camera config, tensor, camera type, torch shim, and camera request setup into
  focused helpers. Metric: 6 -> 5 complexity rows; oversized modules unchanged
  at 62. Proof: focused Isaac backend test, ruff, format check, and ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Planner manipulation checker report fixture builder became
  table-driven, with policy-exception and task-sampler diagnostics fragments in
  focused helpers. Metric: 5 -> 3 complexity rows; oversized modules unchanged
  at 62. Proof: planner manipulation checker contract file, ruff, format check,
  and ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Realworld cleanup checker Isaac robot-view fixture split image

  complexity rows; oversized modules unchanged at 62. Proof: realworld cleanup
  checker contract file, ruff, format check, and ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Operator-console scene-preview map transform split semantic-map
  point collection, padded bounds, and plot geometry helpers. Metric: 1 -> 0
  Ruff complexity rows; oversized modules unchanged at 62. Proof:
  operator-console render-preview tests, ruff, format check, and ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Isaac runtime-smoke USD generation moved from the backend worker
  into `isaac_runtime_smoke_usd.py`, keeping worker-private aliases for the
  existing command/tests. Metric: `isaac_lab_backend_worker.py` 7809 -> 7636
  lines; Ruff complexity stayed at 0 and oversized modules stayed at 62.
  Proof: focused Isaac backend tests, ruff, format check, and ratchet.

- 2026-06-16: Isaac public scene-binding diagnostics and matcher logic moved
  from the backend worker into `isaac_scene_bindings.py`, keeping worker-private
  aliases for current tests and callers. Metric: `isaac_lab_backend_worker.py`
  7636 -> 7339 lines; Ruff complexity stayed at 0 and oversized modules stayed
  at 62. Proof: focused Isaac scene-binding tests, ruff, format check, and
  ratchet.

## Do Not Reopen Without Fresh Evidence

- Backend facade mainline already owns backend id/runtime metadata/artifact
  attachment; reopen only for new backend evidence leakage.
- Live checker and MCP/directed cleanup finalizers already have focused helper
  ownership; reopen only for schema drift or duplicated finalization logic.
- OpenAI live metrics/budget helpers already removed the known production
  complexity rows; file-size hard-ceiling work is still active, but the old
  metrics extraction slice is done.
- Completed report-section extraction is partial evidence, not a reason to
  treat `report.py` as done; the active plan still owns the hard-ceiling split.
