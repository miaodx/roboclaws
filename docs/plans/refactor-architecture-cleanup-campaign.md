# Refactor: Architecture Cleanup Campaign

**Status:** ACTIVE
**Created:** 2026-06-23
**Source:** `$intuitive-reduce-entropy` saturation scan,
`$improve-codebase-architecture` report-only review, `$intuitive-refactor`
ratchet campaign

## Scope

Run repeated, verified refactor slices that make the current architecture
smaller and truer. Prefer stale-surface deletion, duplicate-owner merge,
canonical-owner migration, compatibility shim removal, stale tests/docs
removal, and bounded module deepening.

## Campaign Gate

Campaign overlay: true

Current quality signal:

- Tracked first-party source has 229 Python files and about 91k lines.
- Several current tests still import compatibility owners that the public
  launch path no longer uses.
- High-noise local artifacts exist, but ignored runtime outputs are not in
  scope unless tracked references make them live.

Architecture pressure:

- Public launch axes are canonical in `roboclaws.launch`.
- Thin runtime/server adapters should not preserve obsolete wrappers.
- Tests should prove current owners instead of keeping stale import paths alive.

Verification inventory:

- Focused pytest through `./scripts/dev/run_pytest_standalone.sh ...`.
- Ruff through `.venv/bin/ruff check ...` when source Python changes.
- Stale-reference searches with `rg`.
- `git diff --check` for every slice.

Checkpoint cadence:

- Update `docs/status/active/architecture-cleanup-campaign.md` after each
  verified slice.
- Commit each verified slice atomically.

Active capsule:

- `docs/status/active/architecture-cleanup-campaign.md`

Continue criteria:

- The next slice deletes, merges, or canonicalizes a real concept.
- The slice is internal or has an accepted public migration.
- Focused proof can observe the changed behavior.

Stop/park criteria:

- Product/design decision required.
- Public CLI/import/schema/report migration lacks accepted scope.
- Hardware, credentials, manual proof, or unavailable external contract is
  required.
- Two consecutive post-HEAD discovery handoffs find no clear safe P1/P2 slice
  after shrink attempts.

Discovery source:

- Repo entropy saturation scan against current HEAD.
- Architecture report-only review using Roboclaws domain terms and architecture
  module/interface/seam vocabulary.

Surface metrics:

| Delete Kimi-only key checker wrapper | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | preserved |
| Update stale OpenClaw image-bump docs | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | preserved |

Low-value stop signal:

- Only ignored artifacts, wording polish, single-file neatness, or line motion
  remains.

Discovery cadence:

- Run a fresh reduce-entropy discovery handoff when the candidate queue is
  exhausted.

Consecutive no-clear-candidate passes: 0

## Candidate Queue

Fresh discovery required after stale OpenClaw image-bump doc update.

## Completed Slices

- 2026-06-23: Deleted the test-only `roboclaws.devtools.commands` launch
  compatibility module. Migrated dev-tool route tests to
  `roboclaws.launch.catalog.resolve_surface_launch` and `LaunchError`, so tests
  now prove the canonical public launch catalog directly.

  Proof:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/dev/run_pytest_standalone.sh tests/contract/dev_tools/test_task_agent_just_recipes.py::test_surface_router_is_importable_source_of_truth tests/contract/dev_tools/test_code_just_recipes.py::test_retired_photo_task_facade_rejects_ai2thor_surface -q
  rg -n "roboclaws\.devtools\.commands|resolve_surface_run|CommandError|ResolvedCommand" roboclaws tests docs/human docs/agents just scripts .github pyproject.toml
  git diff --check
  ```

- 2026-06-23: Removed the `LaunchPlan.mode` compatibility accessor and
  migrated tracked callers/tests to the canonical `evidence_mode` field. Kept
  the public trace label `mode=...` unchanged as output text only.

  Proof:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/dev/run_pytest_standalone.sh tests/contract/dev_tools/test_task_agent_just_recipes.py::test_surface_router_is_importable_source_of_truth tests/contract/dev_tools/test_task_agent_just_recipes.py::test_python_launch_plan_accepts_world_labels_sanitized_lane tests/unit/evals/test_eval_runner.py::test_live_surface_command_uses_current_public_launch_axes -q
  rg -n "plan\.mode|resolved\.mode|\.mode ==|\.mode\b" roboclaws tests
  git diff --check
  ```

- 2026-06-23: Removed the unused `TaskSurfaceSpec.name` compatibility accessor.
  No tracked current caller used the alias; launch task specs now expose only
  `surface_id`.

  Proof:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/dev/run_pytest_standalone.sh tests/contract/dev_tools/test_task_agent_just_recipes.py::test_surface_router_is_importable_source_of_truth tests/contract/dev_tools/test_task_agent_just_recipes.py::test_surface_launch_plan_exposes_domain_metadata_before_dispatch tests/unit/launch/test_environment_setup_catalog.py -q
  rg -n "TaskSurfaceSpec|surface\.name|spec\.name|\.name ==|Compatibility accessor|compatibility accessor" roboclaws/launch tests/unit/launch tests/contract/dev_tools docs/human docs/agents just scripts .github pyproject.toml
  git diff --check
  ```

  Note: the first proof attempt used a nonexistent specific test selector in
  `tests/unit/launch/test_environment_setup_catalog.py` and failed during
  collection before executing tests; the corrected focused command above passed.

- 2026-06-23: Deleted the duplicate root
  `examples/molmospaces_realworld_cleanup.py` wrapper. The canonical manual
  wrapper remains at `examples/molmo_cleanup/molmospaces_realworld_cleanup.py`,
  and current tracked callers already use that nested path.

  Proof:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/dev/run_pytest_standalone.sh tests/contract/checkers/test_check_molmo_realworld_cleanup_result.py::test_checker_rejects_legacy_canonical_robot_view_camera_control_flag -q
  python examples/molmo_cleanup/molmospaces_realworld_cleanup.py --help

  git diff --check
  ```

  Note: a broader proof attempt against
  `tests/contract/molmo_cleanup/test_molmospaces_realworld_cleanup.py` exposed
  unrelated current artifact-shape failures around missing
  `agent_view.observed_objects`. The wrapper deletion was narrowed to
  stale-reference and canonical-wrapper proof.

- 2026-06-23: Deleted nine unreferenced root `scripts/*` symlink shims:
  `check_kimi_key.py`, `control_ui_watcher.py`, `network_status.sh`,
  `openclaw-bootstrap.sh`, `openclaw-defaults.env`,
  `openclaw_plugin_allowlist.py`, `regenerate_molmo_cleanup_report.py`,
  `run_pytest_standalone.sh`, and `write_pages_index.py`. Current tracked
  docs, tests, and recipes already use canonical subdirectory paths such as
  `scripts/dev/run_pytest_standalone.sh` and
  `scripts/openclaw/openclaw-bootstrap.sh`.

  Proof:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/dev/run_pytest_standalone.sh tests/unit/providers/test_check_kimi_key.py tests/unit/openclaw/test_control_ui_watcher.py tests/unit/scripts/test_network_status_guard.py tests/contract/openclaw/test_openclaw_bootstrap.py::test_plugins_allow_seeded_from_canonical_allowlist tests/contract/openclaw/test_openclaw_bootstrap.py::test_bootstrap_reads_canonical_plugin_allowlist -q

  git diff --check
  ```

  Note: two earlier OpenClaw proof attempts used nonexistent specific test
  selectors; the corrected command above passed.

- 2026-06-23: Removed the stale `SIM_SERVER_URL` translate-and-warn fallback
  from `scripts/openclaw/openclaw-bootstrap.sh`. The bootstrap interface now
  names only `ROBOCLAWS_MCP_URL`, while the default
  `http://host.docker.internal:18788/mcp` and explicit override behavior are
  preserved. Added a contract guard so the old HTTP sim-server owner does not
  return as a compatibility path.

  Proof:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/dev/run_pytest_standalone.sh tests/contract/openclaw/test_openclaw_bootstrap.py::test_mcp_seeds_server_transport_and_url tests/contract/openclaw/test_openclaw_bootstrap.py::test_mcp_url_env_override_honored tests/contract/openclaw/test_openclaw_bootstrap.py::test_bootstrap_has_no_sim_server_url_compatibility_path -q
  bash -n scripts/openclaw/openclaw-bootstrap.sh

  git diff --check
  ```

  Note: the stale-reference search now returns only the intentional regression
  guard in `tests/contract/openclaw/test_openclaw_bootstrap.py`; production
  bootstrap, recipes, current docs, and runtime adapters no longer reference
  the legacy variable.

- 2026-06-23: Deleted the empty `roboclaws.openclaw` source package and removed
  the pre-commit hook branch that still treated `roboclaws/openclaw/*` as a
  current source owner. OpenClaw maintainer implementation remains under
  `scripts/openclaw/`; the tracked `tests/unit/openclaw` test still targets
  `scripts/openclaw/control_ui_watcher.py` directly.

  Proof:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/dev/run_pytest_standalone.sh tests/contract/dev_tools/test_verify_just_recipes.py::test_pre_commit_runs_scoped_tests_by_default_with_full_fast_opt_in tests/contract/dev_tools/test_verify_just_recipes.py::test_pre_commit_no_longer_infers_retired_domains tests/unit/openclaw/test_control_ui_watcher.py -q
  test ! -e roboclaws/openclaw && python - <<'PY'

  git diff --check
  ```

  Note: local generated `roboclaws/openclaw/__pycache__` files were removed
  before the import proof; they were untracked cache from retired modules. The
  stale-reference search now returns only the intentional regression guard in
  `tests/contract/dev_tools/test_verify_just_recipes.py`.

- 2026-06-23: Deleted `docs/ai/planning/issues-roadmap.md`, an unreferenced
  current-looking AI2-THOR/OpenClaw issue roadmap that conflicted with the
  current issue-tracker source of truth in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` and
  GitHub Issues. Historical planning and retrospective evidence was left
  untouched.

  Proof:

  ```bash
  rg -n "docs/ai/planning/issues-roadmap.md|docs/ai/planning|issues-roadmap.md|GitHub Issues Roadmap|Issue 1: AI2-THOR|roboclaws/openclaw/skill.py|roboclaws/openclaw/bridge.py" README.md ARCHITECTURE.md STATUS.md AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md docs/human docs/agents docs/ai .github just scripts tests pyproject.toml
  test ! -e docs/ai/planning/issues-roadmap.md && test -f docs/agents/issue-tracker.md && test -f docs/agents/triage-labels.md
  git diff --check
  ```

- 2026-06-23: Moved the duplicated operator-console display run id rule from
  `roboclaws.operator_console.history` to the existing
  `roboclaws.operator_console.state` owner. History now calls
  `display_run_id(...)`, so nested wrapper-attempt ids are normalized by one
  operator-state interface instead of two private helpers.

  Proof:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/dev/run_pytest_standalone.sh tests/unit/operator_console/test_state.py::test_state_surfaces_malformed_nested_live_status_and_run_result tests/unit/operator_console/test_state.py::test_state_follows_nested_live_attempt_under_console_wrapper tests/unit/operator_console/test_history.py::test_latest_run_payload_uses_history_index_and_nested_attempt_artifacts tests/unit/operator_console/test_history.py::test_latest_run_payload_surfaces_malformed_run_sidecar -q

  rg -n "def _display_run_id|_display_run_id\(|display_run_id\(" roboclaws/operator_console tests/unit/operator_console -g '*.py'
  git diff --check
  ```

  Note: the first proof attempt used stale specific test selectors and failed
  during collection before executing tests; the corrected focused command above
  passed.

- 2026-06-23: Deleted four private `_is_relative_to` helpers in
  `roboclaws.operator_console.paths`, `roboclaws.operator_console.state`,
  `roboclaws.operator_console.server`, and `roboclaws.devtools.pages_site`.
  The repo's Python floor is 3.12, so these modules now use the native
  `Path.is_relative_to(...)` interface directly for operator artifact serving,
  preview serving, and Pages prune containment checks.

  Proof:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/dev/run_pytest_standalone.sh tests/unit/operator_console/test_operator_console.py::test_operator_console_serves_only_operator_output_artifacts tests/unit/operator_console/test_operator_console.py::test_operator_console_serves_scene_preview_assets tests/contract/reports/test_pages_site_prune.py::test_prune_pages_site_does_not_allow_references_outside_site -q

  rg -n "def _is_relative_to|_is_relative_to\(" roboclaws tests -g '*.py'
  git diff --check
  ```

  Note: the stale-helper search exits with no matches, which is the expected
  result.

- 2026-06-23: Deleted four stale agent-only docs under `docs/ai/` that still
  described retired AI2-THOR/OpenClaw game, refactor-regression, and navigator
  harness surfaces as runnable implementation guidance. Their referenced
  modules, examples, and scripts no longer exist in the current codebase; the
  shipped historical context remains in `.planning/` and current run guidance
  remains in `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `just/README.md`, and
  `docs/human/`.

  Deleted:

  - `docs/ai/deployment/ai2thor-rendering.md`
  - `docs/ai/experiments/refactor-regression.md`
  - `docs/ai/experiments/view-experiment-2026-04.md`

  git diff --check
  ```

- 2026-06-23: Deleted the unused private
  `scripts/dev/provider_timing_proxy.py` wrapper. The provider timing proxy is
  already owned and launched through the module CLI
  `python -m roboclaws.agents.provider_timing_proxy`, including from
  `start_provider_timing_proxy(...)`; the implemented plan text now names only
  the canonical module owner.

  ```

- 2026-06-23: Replaced the stale
  `just openclaw::run photo` command in the OpenClaw image-upgrade checklist
  with the current maintainer dispatcher route
  `just agent::run household-world.cleanup openclaw-gateway world-public-labels`.
  Added a focused contract guard proving the doc no longer points at the
  removed private command and that the current dispatcher trace still resolves
  to the OpenClaw live implementation route without launching Docker or a
  provider.

  Proof:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/dev/run_pytest_standalone.sh -q tests/contract/dev_tools/test_task_agent_just_recipes.py::test_openclaw_image_update_doc_uses_current_maintainer_dispatch

  git diff --check
  ```

  Note: the stale-reference search now returns only intentional regression
  guards in `tests/contract/dev_tools/test_task_agent_just_recipes.py`.

- 2026-06-23: Replaced stale OpenClaw documentation paths that pointed to the
  removed `docs/openclw/` and root `docs/model-matrix.md` locations. OpenClaw
  bootstrap comments, the plugin allow-list module docstring, and OpenClaw
  bootstrap contract-test guidance now point at the current documentation
  owners under `docs/human/openclaw/`, `docs/ai/openclaw/`, and
  `docs/human/model-matrix.md`.

  Proof:

  git diff --check
  ```

  Note: the stale-path search exits with no matches, which is the expected
  result.

- 2026-06-23: Deleted the unused private
  `roboclaws.launch.context` module. Launch callers use the canonical
  `LaunchPlan` and `resolve_surface_launch(...)` interfaces; no tracked code,
  tests, or current docs referenced `LaunchContext`. Added a focused launch
  regression guard so the removed context-holder module does not return as
  launch-package surface area.

  Proof:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/dev/run_pytest_standalone.sh -q tests/unit/launch/test_environment_setup_catalog.py::test_launch_package_does_not_keep_unused_context_holder tests/unit/launch/test_environment_setup_catalog.py::test_launch_backend_catalog_exposes_private_implementation_choices tests/contract/dev_tools/test_task_agent_just_recipes.py::test_surface_router_is_importable_source_of_truth

  ```

  Note: the stale-reference search now returns only the intentional regression
  guard in `tests/unit/launch/test_environment_setup_catalog.py`.

- 2026-06-23: Deleted the no-caller private
  `scripts/reports/regenerate_molmo_cleanup_report.py` wrapper. The current
  owner for cleanup report re-rendering is
  `roboclaws.household.artifact_report`, whose importable
  `rerender_cleanup_reports_from_artifact_paths(...)` function remains covered
  directly by report contract tests.

  Proof:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/dev/run_pytest_standalone.sh -q tests/contract/reports/test_molmo_cleanup_artifact_report.py::test_regenerate_cleanup_report_script_wrapper_stays_removed tests/contract/reports/test_molmo_cleanup_artifact_report.py::test_load_cleanup_scenario_artifact_uses_adjacent_private_manifest

  .venv/bin/ruff check roboclaws/household/artifact_report.py tests/contract/reports/test_molmo_cleanup_artifact_report.py
  git diff --check
  ```

  Note: a broader report re-render proof still hits the pre-existing parked
  Agent View v2 artifact-shape failure (`agent_view.observed_objects` /
  missing `agent_view_v2` sections). The wrapper deletion does not change that
  owner behavior, so this slice used no-caller and importability proof.

- 2026-06-23: Deleted the no-caller private
  `scripts/dev/check_kimi_key.py` wrapper and its wrapper-only tests. Current
  provider health checks are owned by `scripts/dev/check_model_providers.py`,
  which covers both `agents-sdk:kimi-openai-chat` and
  `provider:kimi-coding-chat` routes with Kimi-specific request and response
  guards.

  Proof:

  git diff --check
  ```

  Note: historical plans/research may still mention earlier Kimi-key smoke
  checks as dated evidence. They are not current run guidance and were left as
  history.

- 2026-06-23: Updated current OpenClaw image-bump docs that still pointed
  maintainers at a nonexistent TODO and retired territory/coverage phase
  scripts. The tool-profile note now treats `minimal + alsoAllow` as the
  current default until an image probe or accepted plan changes it, and the
  image-update checklist now names only current OpenClaw maintainer routes.

  Proof:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/dev/run_pytest_standalone.sh -q tests/contract/dev_tools/test_task_agent_just_recipes.py::test_openclaw_image_update_doc_uses_current_maintainer_dispatch

## Parked Candidates

- Public MolmoSpaces `world=molmospaces/val_*` alias removal: current human
  docs still describe selected aliases as launchable. Removing or renaming that
  public surface needs an accepted public command migration. A safe internal
  slice may still rename implementation helpers if it preserves public world ids.
- `tests/contract/molmo_cleanup/test_molmospaces_realworld_cleanup.py`
  current artifact-shape failures: four tests still expect
  `agent_view.observed_objects`. Unblock by deciding whether those tests should
  migrate to Agent View v2 sections or whether the cleanup artifact producer
  should restore a documented compatibility field.
- Obsolete checker flag
  `--require-canonical-robot-view-camera-control`: the checker currently
  recognizes this public flag only to emit an actionable obsolete-flag error
  pointing at `--require-robot-head-camera-fpv`. Removing it would change a
  public checker error path to a generic argparse unknown-flag error. Unblock
  with an accepted public checker CLI migration decision.
