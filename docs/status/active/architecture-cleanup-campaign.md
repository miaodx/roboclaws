# Architecture Cleanup Campaign

Source gate: `docs/plans/refactor-architecture-cleanup-campaign.md`

Latest user intent: autonomous architecture cleanup campaign with high
autonomy; continue through verified commit slices until a stop gate or two
post-HEAD discovery handoffs find no clear safe P1/P2 slice.

Current slice:

- Fresh discovery handoff after the stale `docs/ai/planning/issues-roadmap.md`
  deletion slice.

Last proven evidence:

- Deleted unreferenced `docs/ai/planning/issues-roadmap.md`, which described an
  old AI2-THOR/OpenClaw issue roadmap as current triage guidance.
- Stale-reference search found no current references to the deleted doc or its
  retired module paths, and `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` remains the current
  issue-tracker source.
- `git diff --check` passed.

Completed slice batch:

- Slice 1: canonicalized launch route tests on `roboclaws.launch.catalog` and
  removed one shallow compatibility module.
- Slice 2: removed one launch-plan compatibility alias while preserving public
  trace text.
- Slice 3: removed one unused launch task-spec compatibility alias.
- Slice 4: removed one duplicate root example wrapper while preserving the
  canonical nested manual wrapper.
- Slice 5: removed nine root script symlink shims while preserving canonical
  subdirectory scripts.
- Slice 6: removed the OpenClaw bootstrap's stale `SIM_SERVER_URL`
  compatibility fallback while preserving canonical `ROBOCLAWS_MCP_URL`
  defaulting and overrides.
- Slice 7: removed the empty `roboclaws.openclaw` source package and stopped
  the pre-commit hook from routing staged changes in that retired package.
- Slice 8: removed an unreferenced AI planning roadmap that conflicted with
  the current GitHub issue tracker guidance.

Next proof:

```bash
Run a fresh `$intuitive-reduce-entropy` discovery handoff against current HEAD.
```

Stop condition:

- Stop for public contract migration, unavailable proof, external/hardware
  evidence, or two consecutive fresh post-HEAD no-clear-candidate handoffs.

No-touch scope:

- Do not remove historical plan/ADR evidence solely because it names retired
  surfaces.
- Do not change live simulator/provider behavior in this campaign without a
  focused proof gate.

Parked work:

- Public MolmoSpaces `world=molmospaces/val_*` alias removal needs an accepted
  public command migration; current docs still describe selected aliases as
  launchable.
- Broader cleanup demo contract tests currently fail on missing
  `agent_view.observed_objects`; resolve as a separate Agent View v2/test
  migration decision.
- Obsolete checker flag removal needs public checker CLI migration approval
  because it would change an actionable error into a generic unknown-flag error.
