# Cross-Environment Map Waypoint Source Of Truth

Source plan:
`docs/plans/2026-06-20-cross-environment-map-waypoint-source-of-truth.md`

Latest user intent: approved implementation via `$intuitive-flow`.

Current slice: implementation complete; final acceptance audit passed.

Completed:

- Added strict `validate_base_navigation_map_v1_bundle()` product gate.
- B1 base-map generation and Digital Twin sidecar generation now call the
  strict validator.
- Added shared area-based `BaseWaypointBuilder` and wired B1 / Map 12 through
  it.
- Split MolmoSpaces Base Navigation Map preparation away from
  `RealWorldCleanupContract` / Agent View projection.
- Regenerated `assets/maps/molmospaces/procthor-10k-val/0` as a fixture-free
  strict Base Navigation Map v1 bundle with 7 rooms, 7 base waypoints, and 0
  static landmarks.
- Removed product Agent View snapshot fallback; product snapshots now require
  a selected source bundle.
- Runtime product map selection validates strict Base Navigation Map v1 and
  consumes artifact-authored base waypoints.
- Updated product checkers for canonical area-inspection waypoint ids and
  semantic-success evidence.

Key proof facts:

- `nav2_map_bundle.source_bundle_root` is
  `assets/maps/molmospaces/procthor-10k-val/0`.
- `nav2_map_bundle.snapshot_complete` is `true`.
- Runtime observed object count is 5.
- Copied snapshot `semantics.json` has 7 rooms, 7 base waypoints, and 0
  `static_landmarks`.
- Runtime static map fixture count is 0.

No-touch scope:

- Existing unrelated refactor/python-quality files.
- Existing unrelated live runtime / JSON source / report changes.
- Existing untracked SDK storage active note.

Parked:

- Broad cleanup of older checker tests that still use synthetic no-bundle smoke
  helpers is outside this plan; the product path now fails loudly without a
  selected bundle as intended.
