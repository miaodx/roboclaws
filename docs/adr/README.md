# Architecture Decision Records

This directory is the current durable architecture decision surface for
Roboclaws. Keep it small. ADRs here should constrain future implementation:
public command/API shape, MCP/tool contracts, private-data boundaries,
provider/cost/privacy boundaries, or durable subsystem ownership.

Do not use ADRs for phase logs, benchmark notes, proof reruns, implementation
checklists, or local validation handoffs. Those belong in `docs/plans/`,
`docs/status/active/`, `docs/retrospectives/`, or run artifacts.

Archived records remain available for traceability, but they are not current
guidance:

- [`archive/historical/`](archive/historical/) for decisions absorbed by the
  current architecture or no longer worth keeping on the read-first surface.
- [`archive/superseded/`](archive/superseded/) for records replaced by a newer
  current ADR.
- [`archive/execution-log/`](archive/execution-log/) for older ADR-shaped phase
  execution notes.

## Adding A New ADR

1. Write an ADR only when the decision is durable and constrains future work.
2. Prefer updating `ARCHITECTURE.md` or `docs/human/**` when the architecture is
   already stable and the doc just needs to reflect it.
3. Use the next number above the highest ADR-shaped record in the repo. Do not
   fill gaps left by archived records.
4. Keep the ADR short. Link to a plan for phases, commands, tests, gates, and
   implementation sequencing.
5. Never rewrite a past ADR's decision body. Supersede it with a new ADR that
   references the old one, then move the old ADR to `archive/superseded/`.

## Archive Rule

When an ADR stops constraining current architecture, move it out of the root
decision surface. Do not keep stale records in the root just because they once
were accepted.
