# ADR-0138: Use Detector-Only Visual Grounding Sidecar

Status: Accepted

Date: 2026-06-12

## Context

ADR-0133 introduced the HTTP Visual Grounding Service and allowed hosted VLM
refiners and direct producers as comparison modes. That was useful while the
repo still explored many visual-labeling routes.

The current product shape is leaner: household-world and planner-proof are the
active surfaces, and visual grounding should provide camera-derived object
evidence without keeping hosted VLM direct/refiner paths alive as runtime
choices.

## Decision

Keep the HTTP visual-grounding sidecar boundary, but make the active current
contract detector-only.

Current visual-grounding runtime choices should be local detector labelers such
as Grounding DINO, YOLOE, YOLO-World, and OmDet-Turbo.

ADR-0143 later narrows this contract further: `sim-projected-labels`,
`fake-http`, and `contract-fake` are no longer active public/operator/product
camera labelers or current validation routes.

Retire hosted VLM visual-grounding camera labelers, refiner stages, and direct
producer stages from active code, command examples, tests, and benchmark
promotion logic. This includes hosted Gemini, MiMo, Qwen, Tongyi, SiliconFlow,
and similar VLM slots when used as camera-labeler/refiner/direct-producer
routes.

Do not remove generic model/provider routing used by Codex, Claude Code,
OpenAI Agents SDK, OpenClaw text routes, model matrix flows, or future explicit
model experiments.

Gemini remains parked historical knowledge: it was strong for image/video
understanding and data labeling, and DINO plus Gemini improved one historical
cleanup result. Reintroducing Gemini should require a fresh explicit plan and
a bounded offline/on-demand labeling use case.

## Consequences

- The Visual Grounding Service remains a sidecar boundary, not an MCP tool.
- Current camera-grounded household runs should not expose hosted VLM
  direct/refiner camera labelers.
- Benchmarks should select among detector-only candidates, not direct VLM,
  proposer-plus-refiner promotions, sim projection, or fake transports as
  current validation proof.
- Historical plans, reports, and archived ADR-0133 may retain old VLM evidence,
  but current human docs and command surfaces must mark it retired or parked.
- The implementation plan is
