# 0134. Use Public Done Readiness Gates

Date: 2026-06-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

ADR-0003 separates the Cleanup Agent's public view from private evaluation
truth. ADR-0006 exposes the cleanup contract through bounded MCP tools, including
`done`, while ADR-0011 already makes invalid cleanup order an executable public
contract instead of a prompt-only convention. ADR-0132 keeps cleanup memory
skill-first but makes contract-derived facts authoritative for `done` gates,
reports, and checkers.

Recent RAW_FPV live runs showed another form of false completion: an agent could
call `done` after inspecting visual candidates without completing enough
grounded cleanup chains. Prompt guidance helped but was not authoritative, and
embedding RAW_FPV-specific checks directly in the MCP server risks turning the
server orchestration layer into a growing collection of task/profile branches.

## Decision

Roboclaws will treat task/profile-specific completion readiness as a server-side
Done Readiness Gate. A `done` call remains the public lifecycle tool, but before
finalization the runtime may evaluate one or more readiness policies derived
from public run state.

Done Readiness Gates must use only public/runtime evidence available through the
cleanup contract boundary:

- Agent View state;
- public MCP tool requests and responses;
- public cleanup worklists or semantic substeps derived from traces;
- public run acceptance configuration such as the requested run size or profile.

The first run-size-derived grounded-cleanup-chain policy is scoped to
`camera-raw` / RAW_FPV runs. Structured `world-labels` lanes may still opt into
an explicit grounded-chain requirement, but they must use world-label recovery
tooling such as `navigate_to_object`, not RAW_FPV-only visual-candidate recovery.

They must not use or expose private generated mess membership, acceptable
destination sets, hidden target lists, private manifests, hidden target
receptacles, `is_misplaced`, or scorer object truth.

Rejected `done` calls should return an additive public blocker structure while
preserving existing top-level recovery fields during migration:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "tool": "done",
  "status": "blocked",
  "error_reason": "insufficient_grounded_cleanup_chains",
  "required_tool": "navigate_to_visual_candidate",
  "completion": {
    "status": "blocked",
    "blockers": [
      {
        "type": "insufficient_grounded_cleanup_chains",
        "current": 3,
        "required": 4,
        "required_tool": "navigate_to_visual_candidate"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Numeric blocker fields may expose public progress and the minimum public
acceptance requirement for the run, but they must not label that value as a
private target count or reveal private target identities. Skills should consume
the blocker generically: follow `required_tool` and public recovery hints, then
call `done` again after more public evidence is complete.

The MCP tool surface should not grow a separate default `cleanup_worklist` or
`check_done_ready` tool solely for this purpose. The authoritative completion
check belongs on `done`; optional helper scripts or skill scratchpads may use
the same public tool results, but they are not the source of truth.

## Considered Options

- Keep this in prompts and skills only. This keeps MCP small, but it cannot
  guarantee completion correctness because live agents can ignore instructions,
  lose count, or loop on visual candidates.
- Add a new MCP readiness tool. This gives agents a proactive query path, but it
  expands the public surface and still lets an agent skip the query and call
  `done`.
- Put every profile-specific completion rule directly into the MCP server. This
  is quick for one bug, but it grows server orchestration around task/profile
  branches and makes future readiness rules harder to test in isolation.
- Use a Done Readiness Gate evaluated by `done`. This keeps the MCP surface
  stable, makes completion enforcement authoritative, and lets profile-specific
  policies be tested as explicit runtime strategies.

## Consequences

- `done` blockers become part of the public response contract, not just ad hoc
  recovery text.
- Skills can be simpler and more extensible: they react to public blockers
  instead of carrying private or profile-specific completion truth.
- Completion policies need focused tests for public/private boundary safety,
  blocker shape, and trace-derived progress.
- The first implementation can keep existing top-level `error_reason` and
  `required_tool` fields while adding `completion.blockers` for forward
  compatibility.
