# Eval Harness

Use this skill when a Roboclaws plan, diff, PR, or agent-facing change needs
one maintainer proof surface. The skill answers:

1. which deterministic gates, product runs, eval suites, and live-agent evals
   are relevant;
2. why each row was selected, skipped, run, failed, or blocked;
3. where the resulting reports and regression-promotion evidence live.

It is an orchestration skill, not a robot behavior skill. Keep task strategy in
task skills such as `molmo-realworld-cleanup`; keep reusable robot capability
semantics in MCP tools and capability profiles.

## Commands

Recommend rows without running them:

```bash
just agent::eval recommend plan=docs/plans/example.md budget=focused
```

Execute relevant rows for a plan or diff:

```bash
just agent::eval execute plan=docs/plans/example.md budget=focused
just agent::eval execute since=origin/main budget=focused
```

Run one versioned suite directly as a lower-level row/debugging path:

```bash
just agent::eval suite=cleanup_capability budget=smoke
```

Promote failed, blocked, or inconclusive eval evidence:

```bash
just agent::eval promote-regression \
  eval_results=output/evals/<suite>/<stamp>/eval_results.json \
  source_sample_id=<sample-id> \
  regression_sample_id=regression.<name>
```

## Budgets

- `recommend`: never executes rows; it lists commands and preflight needs.
- `execute budget=smoke`: deterministic confidence only; selected expensive or
  live rows are recorded as skipped by user budget.
- `execute budget=focused`: default maintainer mode; selected required live
  rows must run or record explicit blocked evidence.
- `execute budget=full`: run required and recommended selected rows unless
  environment, network, provider, hardware, or guard preflight blocks them.

Never downgrade a selected live-agent eval into deterministic-only success.
Missing provider keys, provider 5xx/429, and model-service failures are
`model_or_provider_unavailable`. Missing Docker, simulator/runtime, DINO
sidecar, Python env, or live-session capacity is `environment_blocked`.

## Outputs

Each run writes:

```text
output/eval-harness/<stamp>/
  eval_harness.json
  eval_harness.md
  eval_harness.html
  rows/<row-id>/
  evals/<suite-id>/<stamp>/
```

The manifest schema is `roboclaws_eval_harness_manifest_v1`. Rows use
`roboclaws_eval_harness_row_v1` and may be `deterministic_gate`,
`product_run`, `eval_suite`, `live_agent_eval`, `regression_promotion`, or
`manual_review`.

## Selection Rules

The selector is deterministic and rule-table based over plan text, git diff
paths, and explicit overrides. It does not use an LLM classifier.

Important signals:

- Eval harness, eval CLI, eval reports, or regression promotion select eval
  unit tests and `smoke_regression`.
- Runtime Metric Map, map-build, actionability, or waypoint files select
  `map_build_consumer`.
- Cleanup skill, prompt, MCP policy, checker, or done-readiness files select
  cleanup contract gates, `cleanup_capability`, and focused/full live eval rows.
- Agent SDK, provider profile, or live-runtime files select route/preflight
  checks and affected live-agent eval rows.
- Visual grounding, DINO, camera labeler, or RAW-FPV files select perception or
  camera product rows.
- Docs-only command taxonomy or skill guidance changes should select docs and
  route checks, with eval rows only when the docs claim behavior changed.

Do not use or recreate a user-facing `agent-validation-matrix` route. Historical
plans may mention it, but maintained guidance should point at `@eval-harness`
and `just agent::eval recommend|execute|suite|promote-regression`.
