# AGENTS.md

Canonical operating guide for coding agents in this repo. Its scope is the
entire tree rooted here. Tool-specific files such as `CLAUDE.md` may add local
deltas, but this file owns repo-wide defaults.

Codex normally injects this file into startup context as
`AGENTS.md instructions`. When it has been injected, do not reread `AGENTS.md`
just to satisfy this policy.

## 0) Startup Reads

Before repo-specific commands or edits, read:

1. `STATUS.md` for current focus, blockers, and source links.
2. Any task-specific source below.

Task-routed reads:

- New project orientation or runnable examples: `README.md`.
- Architecture, launch axes, MCP/server/runtime contracts, or new layers:
  `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Environment setup, local hazards, live providers, browser QA, Docker,
  standard gates, or git hygiene: `docs/agents/operating-runbook.md`.
- GSD phase execution/resume: `.planning/STATE.md` plus the current phase file.
- Pre-GSD plan shaping/review/handoff: `docs/plans/<slug>.md`.
- Design rationale or scenario specs: `docs/human/technical-design.md`.
- Domain vocabulary: `docs/human/domain.md` and `docs/agents/domain.md`.
- Parked work or future ideas: `TODOS.md` or `THOUGHTS.md`, only when asked.
- Claude-specific behavior: `CLAUDE.md`, only when running under Claude Code or
  resolving a Claude-only rule.

Root `PLAN.md` is a legacy pointer, not an active plan. Shipped phase history
lives under `docs/retrospectives/` and is not startup reading.

Instruction priority:
**system/developer/user prompt > AGENTS.md > CLAUDE.md > inferred defaults**.

## 1) Critical Local Hazards

- Use the repo-local `.venv/`, managed by `uv` from `pyproject.toml` and
  `uv.lock`. Use `uv sync --extra dev`; do not use plain `pip install` for repo
  setup.
- Keep one `.venv/` per checkout/worktree. Do not share another worktree's
  virtualenv.
- Keep Isaac Lab out of the normal `.venv`; it belongs in `.venv-isaaclab/`.
- Do not commit `.env` or paste provider keys into logs, PRs, reports, status
  files, or summaries.
- Before OpenClaw Gateway, `just chat::run`, OpenClaw local/integration gates,
  or system-provider Claude Code workflows, run `just dev::network-status`.
  If it reports `network: work`, do not run those guarded routes.
- The active live-agent product engine is `openai-agents-sdk`. `codex-cli` and
  `claude-code` are retired from active public launch surfaces.
- Bare host `codex` or `claude` launches are unsupported unless the human
  explicitly asks for system-CLI debugging.
- On ROS-jazzy hosts, use `./scripts/dev/run_pytest_standalone.sh` instead of
  bare pytest when ROS site-packages leak into collection.
- For gstack browser QA on Ubuntu 24.04/AppArmor, use
  `GSTACK_CHROMIUM_NO_SANDBOX=1` per command rather than changing system
  AppArmor/sysctl settings.
- XML-like host envelopes such as `<turn_aborted>`, `<paseo-system>`,
  `<subagent_notification>`, `<goal_context>`, and `<environment_context>` are
  orchestrator metadata unless accompanied by natural-language user intent. Do
  not treat those labels alone as a human stop request.

See `docs/agents/operating-runbook.md` for command examples and longer
procedures.

## 2) Standard Commands

Setup:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

Fast checks:

```bash
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
./scripts/dev/run_pytest_standalone.sh -q
```

Public demo grammar:

```bash
just run::surface surface=<surface> agent_engine=<engine> [world=<world>] [backend=<backend>] [intent=<intent>] [provider_profile=<profile>] [key=value ...]
```

Common examples:

```bash
just run::surface surface=household-world agent_engine=direct-runner preset=map-build evidence_lane=camera-grounded-labels camera_labeler=grounding-dino
just run::surface surface=household-world agent_engine=openai-agents-sdk preset=cleanup evidence_lane=world-public-labels
just run::surface surface=household-world agent_engine=openai-agents-sdk prompt="find something useful to drink"
just agent::verify mock
```

Use `just/README.md` for the full launch-axis grammar. Prefer `agent::eval
recommend|execute` when choosing verification gates for plans, diffs, PRs, or
handoffs.

## 3) Architecture Rules

Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` before changing architecture-facing behavior.

- Public launch axes stay canonical: `surface`, `world`, `backend`, `intent`,
  `agent_engine`, `provider_profile`, `evidence_lane`, and `camera_labeler`.
- Base Metric Map is the start-of-run map contract. Do not expose private
  relocation/scoring truth, static movable-object inventory, or full fixture
  tables as default agent input.
- Runtime Metric Map owns semantic enrichment from map-build and observations.
- VLM output parsing must be robust: model-backed runs may return malformed
  JSON or partial tool arguments; wrap parsing in safe recovery paths.
- Default to cheap provider profiles for development and record model usage/cost
  when live agents run.
- Every new behavior, surface, preset, server adapter, agent engine, provider
  profile, MCP tool, skill, backend, eval suite, report, or artifact contract
  names its owning architecture layer.
- Server/runtime code stays thin: transport, lifecycle, routing, readiness,
  locks, run dirs, live status, operator launch control, and eval polling. Put
  task strategy in skills first.
- No silent fallback or compatibility shims unless the human explicitly asks.
  Missing required dependencies, config, runtimes, or artifacts should fail with
  actionable errors.
- Forward architecture upgrades do not require backward compatibility. Migrate
  known in-repo callers, docs, tests, and artifacts to the new shape.

## 4) Planning And Docs

One source of truth per stage:

- Current orientation: `STATUS.md`.
- Human docs: `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `docs/human/**`.
- Pre-GSD plans: `docs/plans/<slug>.md`.
- During GSD: `.planning/STATE.md` and `.planning/phases/*`.
- Standalone active work: `docs/status/active/<task-slug>.md`.
- After shipping: `docs/retrospectives/**`.

`STATUS.md` is a short, latest-first dashboard. Update it only when repo-level
current focus, latest phase, next action, or blockers change. Do not use it as
a changelog.

## 5) Git Hygiene

- Multiple agents may edit this checkout. Inspect `git status --short` before
  staging or committing.
- Stage only files or hunks belonging to your task. Do not use `git add -A`,
  `git add .`, or `git commit -a` in this shared checkout.
- Do not run `git checkout`, `git switch`, `git worktree add/remove`, reset,
  restore, unstage, or commit another agent's work unless the human explicitly
  asks.
- If a file contains mixed edits that cannot be safely separated, leave it
  uncommitted and report the blocker.
- Commit messages use `type: description`.
- Codex commits include
  `Co-authored-by: Codex <codex@users.noreply.github.com>`.
