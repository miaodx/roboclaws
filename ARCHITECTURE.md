# Architecture

Roboclaws is a thin robotics demo repo. Its architecture goal is not to hide
robot work behind one opaque tool; it is to make every run reviewable through
public surface, prompt/preset inputs, MCP tool traces, maps, reports, and
private-evaluation boundaries.

For commands, start with [`README.md`](README.md). For the
surface/preset/skill/profile model, read
[`docs/human/mcp-skills-and-semantic-profiles.md`](docs/human/mcp-skills-and-semantic-profiles.md).

![Architecture diagram](docs/architecture.svg)

## Core Model

The current human-facing layers are:

```text
Open-ended goal
  -> Runnable Surface, World / Scene, Intent, and optional Preset
  -> Agent Skill
  -> Agent Engine and Provider Profile
  -> Capability Profile requirements
  -> MCP Capability Contract and Tools
  -> Thin Runtime / Server Adapter
  -> Backend Runtime / Environment Primitive
  -> Artifacts, reports, and eval suites
```

Evaluation is a first-class maintainer layer beside product runs, not a
replacement for the launch surface:

```text
Product run
  just run::surface ...

Eval harness
  just agent::eval recommend|execute ...
  Selects and runs deterministic gates, product rows, eval suites, live-agent
  evals, blocked evidence, and regression-promotion guidance for a plan, diff,
  or explicit request.

Eval suite
  Versioned capability benchmark artifact under the facade: samples, trials,
  graders, aggregate metrics, failure classes, and replayable regression
  evidence.

Harness recipes
  Lower-level runners and probes used by product, validation, and eval flows.
```

- **Runnable Surfaces And Presets** are public run contracts such as
  `surface=household-world prompt=...`,
  `surface=household-world preset=map-build`,
  `surface=household-world preset=cleanup`, and
  `surface=planner-proof intent=planner-proof`. They own command names,
  parameters, report shape, and acceptance gates.
- **Worlds / Scenes** are operator-facing rooms, maps, or digital twins such as
  `world=molmospaces/val_0`, `world=agibot-g2/map-12`,
  `world=b1-map12`, or `world=planner-proof/default`.
- **Backend Runtimes** are execution adapter ids such as `backend=mujoco`,
  `backend=isaaclab`, or `backend=agibot-gdk`. Product support is
  world-scoped: MolmoSpaces household scenes use MuJoCo, B1 / Map 12 uses
  Isaac Lab, and Agibot map runs use Agibot GDK.
- **Agent Skills** own strategy: prompts, scripts, examples, recovery loops,
  and trace-preserving routines such as `navigate -> pick -> place`.
- **Agent Engines And Provider Profiles** distinguish the product runtime
  (`agent_engine=codex-cli`, `claude-code`, or `openai-agents-sdk`) from the
  model/key route (`provider_profile=codex-router-responses`,
  `mimo-mify-responses`, `mimo-tp-anthropic`, and related profiles).
  `direct-runner` is the deterministic contract/eval baseline, not a live robot
  agent runtime.
  Validation-required maintainer engines stay outside the normal public engine
  list until their separate proof gates are green. The active stabilization
  focus is coding-agent routes and the OpenAI Agents SDK route; higher-level
  agent frameworks are later clients after those lower routes are stable.
- **Capability Profiles** define reusable capability environments. Skills
  require profiles; profiles should not be copied into task-specific supersets.
- **MCP Capability Contract And Tools** are the stable public robot interface:
  observe, navigate, map, pick, place, done, and related bounded capabilities.
  MCP is where public capability contracts and tool-order validation responses
  belong; task strategy should stay in skills unless behavior has met the MCP
  promotion rule.
- **Thin Runtime / Server Adapters** bind the MCP transport and lifecycle:
  fixed server targets, host/port, readiness, pid/lock files, output dirs,
  live-agent status, operator-console launch control, and eval live-run polling.
  They are plumbing, not a behavior layer. They must not own cleanup/search/map
  strategy, private scoring truth, benchmark-specific hints, or opaque
  multi-tool task shortcuts.
- **Backend Runtimes / Environment Primitives** execute environment-specific
  actions behind the public MCP contract. Backend variants stay in metadata and
  adapters, not in public task names.
- **Eval Suites** are repo-owned benchmarks that run selected product surfaces
  through versioned samples, deterministic graders, optional advisory graders,
  aggregate metrics such as `pass@k` / `pass^k`, and failure replay. Their first
  maintainer facade is `just agent::eval ...`.

The real-robot rule is: physical runs should reuse the same surface, intent,
skill, profile, and MCP tool layers. They differ by backend variant,
provenance, safety gates, operator map context, and blocked-capability status.

## Major Stacks

Roboclaws currently centers on the household-world demo stack. Retired demos
may still appear in historical plans or archived reports, but they are not
current public launch axes and should not be revived without a new architecture
decision.

### Household World And Cleanup

This stack proves household world understanding, semantic cleanup, runtime maps,
and future physical robot parity.

Key pieces:

- `roboclaws/household/realworld_contract.py` owns the public/private
  household contract.
- `roboclaws/household/agent_view.py` owns the sectioned Agent View v2 boundary
  for public household-world agent inputs, saved `agent_view.json` artifacts,
  live agent-facing responses, and sidecar public-evidence guards.
- `roboclaws/household/realworld_cleanup.py` owns the direct deterministic
  cleanup and map-build sweep CLI used by `just` and harness recipes.
- `roboclaws/household/semantic_cleanup_loop.py` owns the direct semantic
  cleanup flow.
- `roboclaws/maps/` owns reusable navigation map artifacts, projections, and
  Runtime Map Prior Snapshot conversion.
- `roboclaws/household/realworld_mcp_server.py` exposes the cleanup MCP
  capability surface for coding agents and future higher-level MCP clients.
- `roboclaws/cli/household_agent_server.py` and
  `roboclaws/cli/agibot_map_build_agent_server.py` are thin server adapters
  that assemble live household MCP server processes behind
  `python -m roboclaws.cli.agent_server ...`.
- `roboclaws/household/report.py` renders the shared report.
- `roboclaws/household/camera_control.py` owns the external render-camera
  request schema used by MuJoCo product runs and B1/generic Isaac probes.
- `roboclaws/household/agibot_sdk_runner.py` owns the Roboclaws-side Agibot
  SDK subprocess adapter, including conversion of SDK-local exports into the
  public household Agent View v2 artifact. The vendor runner at
  `vendors/agibot_sdk/tools/run_agibot_cleanup_backend.py` stays SDK-local.
- `roboclaws/operator_console/` provides the standalone local agent operator
  console. It exposes explicit coding-agent route metadata, per-backend locks,
  route gates, normalized live operator state, redacted raw-log access, and
  links to existing run artifacts. It starts catalog-approved runs and surfaces
  state; it does not own robot task strategy.

The clean-slate direction is:

- `surface=household-world preset=map-build` produces Runtime Metric Map
  snapshots, which can be wrapped as a Runtime Map Prior Snapshot for
  downstream task consumption.
- `surface=household-world preset=cleanup` runs cleanup.
- `surface=household-world prompt=...` runs the no-preset household open-task
  contract with agent-declared completion and public evidence.
- The canonical map flow is minimal-first: start from occupancy/free-space
  navigation context, run `preset=map-build`, then feed the resulting
  `runtime_metric_map.json` or `runtime_map_prior_snapshot.json` to
  cleanup with `runtime_map_prior=...` when a prior sweep is useful.
- Offline Agibot `navigation_memory.json` conversion happens at the map-artifact
  boundary and produces the same Runtime Map Prior Snapshot contract;
  cleanup and open household tasks should not add Agibot-only loading branches.
- `household_world` is the reusable world-understanding capability profile.
- Manipulation capability should be composed as a separate requirement when a
  skill needs `pick`, `place`, `open_receptacle`, or `close_receptacle`.

## Public Command Surface

The public command grammar is intentionally small:

```bash
just run::surface surface=<surface> agent_engine=<engine> [world=<world>] [backend=<backend>] [intent=<intent>] [provider_profile=<profile>] [key=value ...]
```

Examples:

```bash
just run::surface surface=household-world world=molmospaces/val_0 backend=mujoco preset=map-build agent_engine=openai-agents-sdk provider_profile=codex-router-responses evidence_lane=camera-grounded-labels camera_labeler=grounding-dino scenario_setup=baseline seed=7
just run::surface surface=household-world world=molmospaces/val_0 backend=mujoco preset=cleanup agent_engine=direct-runner evidence_lane=world-public-labels scenario_setup=relocate-cleanup-related-objects seed=7
just run::surface surface=household-world world=molmospaces/val_0 backend=mujoco agent_engine=codex-cli provider_profile=codex-router-responses prompt="find something useful to drink"
just run::surface surface=planner-proof world=planner-proof/default backend=mujoco intent=planner-proof agent_engine=direct-runner mode=dry-run
just console::run
```

Backend availability is validated against the selected world. MolmoSpaces
household worlds expose `backend=mujoco`; `backend=isaaclab` is current for
`world=b1-map12`, not as a MolmoSpaces alternative.

For household runs, callers pass the cleanup input/evidence lane explicitly as
`evidence_lane=...`.
`evidence_lane` decides what the agent sees. Supported current lanes are
`world-public-labels`, `camera-grounded-labels`, and `camera-raw-fpv`.
`camera-grounded-labels` additionally requires `camera_labeler=...`; the
default deployment-like producer is `grounding-dino`, with `yoloe`,
`yolo-world`, and `omdet-turbo` available for comparison. `camera_labeler` is
invalid for world-label and raw-FPV lanes. The `smoke` token remains a cheap
synthetic preset, not an evidence lane.

Cleanup lanes do not select online/offline map behavior. The default
start-of-run map context is the Base Metric Map: occupancy geometry,
generated exploration candidates, and public room-category hints when
available. Use `runtime_map_prior=...` to consume a raw runtime map or canonical
Runtime Map Prior Snapshot prior. Historical `minimal` / `rich` map
artifacts may still be readable, but current product docs should not ask
operators or agents to choose those modes.

The clean-slate household public shape is `surface=household-world` plus a
natural-language prompt or an optional preset. `preset=map-build` produces Runtime Metric Map evidence,
`runtime_map_prior_snapshot_v1` is the canonical downstream artifact
contract, and `preset=cleanup` consumes household-world evidence for cleanup.
Older task/profile names such as `semantic-map-build`, `household-cleanup`,
and Molmo-specific profile names are historical/report-only terms, not the
canonical task layer or active compatibility contract.

`just console::run` starts a standalone local operator console for supported
coding-agent household routes. The console does not expose arbitrary shell
commands: world, backend, intent, agent engine, provider profile, evidence lane,
and scenario setup all resolve through the public launch catalog.

## Evaluation Layer

Eval suites answer whether a household or planner-proof capability is improving
over time. A suite is made of versioned samples; each sample resets an
environment, runs one or more agent trials, records traces and artifacts, grades
state/outcome, trajectory, privacy, artifacts, and efficiency, then aggregates
metrics and failure classes.

Eval suites must preserve the same public/private boundary as product runs.
Private generated mess sets, acceptable destinations, hidden target lists, and
scorer truth remain grader inputs or private report evidence; they do not become
MCP profile metadata, skill instructions, or agent-facing tool responses.
Cleanup evals should treat a `static_fixture_projection` MCP call as a trajectory violation
because current cleanup MCP servers no longer expose that tool. Historical
`static_fixture_projection` artifact fields may remain readable for map bundles, reports,
and compatibility checks.

The first implementation is intentionally repo-native under `evals/` and
`roboclaws/evals/`. The schema layer defines `eval_suite`, `eval_sample`,
`eval_trial`, and `eval_result` packets plus direct-runner fixtures; the first
deterministic runner is exposed as `just agent::eval suite=smoke_regression
budget=smoke`. Do not add a third-party eval framework until deterministic
household suites have proven the sample, artifact, grader, privacy, and result
packet contracts that Roboclaws needs.

The maintained orchestration facade is `eval-harness`, exposed through
`just agent::eval recommend|execute|suite|promote-regression`. It supersedes the
old separate `agent-validation-matrix` entrypoint. Eval-harness manifests use
`roboclaws_eval_harness_manifest_v1` and may link maintainer-only private
artifacts, but must not inline private scorer truth, hidden targets, acceptable
destinations, generated mess sets, private manifests, or raw provider logs.

Live eval execution is opt-in. Non-direct eval requests can record blocked
identity/preflight packets without launching real providers; `live_execution=run`
is the explicit switch that runs the selected product route. Provider/runtime
failures are classified separately from agent behavior failures.

## Capability Profiles

`roboclaws/mcp/profiles.py` defines current MCP capability metadata. The
household head is `household_world`, composed with
`household_episode` for no-preset open tasks and map-build, and with
`household_manipulation` for cleanup skills.
Older backend/domain ids such as `molmospaces_cleanup_v1` and
`real_robot_cleanup_v1` are historical/report-only artifact terms, not active
selectable capability profiles.

Going forward:

- Add a new runnable surface or preset by adding a domain `tasks.py` spec and
  registering it in `roboclaws/launch/catalog.py`; keep behavior in the domain
  package.
- Add a new world or scene in `roboclaws/launch/worlds.py`, and expose only
  operator-facing ids such as room, map, or digital-twin names.
- Add a new backend runtime in `roboclaws/launch/backends.py` as a reusable
  adapter boundary; implementation backend ids stay private metadata.
- Add a new agent engine in `roboclaws/launch/agent_engines.py`. For live
  coding agents, shared launcher and status semantics should flow through
  `roboclaws/agents/live_runtime.py`, with task-specific kickoff text in
  `roboclaws/agents/prompts/`.
- Add or revise thin server adapters only for transport and lifecycle concerns:
  MCP server target routing, host/port, readiness, locks, run directories,
  live status, operator-console run control, or eval live-run polling. If the
  change needs task strategy or multi-step behavior, put it in a skill first or
  promote it through the MCP capability contract only after the boundary is
  stable.
- Add or revise MCP tools in the domain-local MCP module when the capability
  surface is stable enough to reuse across skills.
- Profiles describe reusable capability environments, not whole tasks.
- Skills compose profiles by requirement; profiles should not copy other
  profiles' tool lists.
- Backend variants belong in metadata/config, not in public task names.
- Private relocation/generated mess sets, acceptable destinations, hidden target lists,
  private manifests, and private scorer truth must not appear in public profile
  metadata or agent-facing inputs.

## Runtime Artifacts

Every serious run should produce reviewable evidence:

- `trace.jsonl` for tool calls and state transitions.
- `agent_view.json` / `run_result.json` for public agent-facing state. Current
  household Agent View artifacts use `schema=agent_view_v2` with task,
  capabilities, Base Metric Map, Runtime Metric Map, active perception,
  policy, readiness, and privacy sections.
- `model_call_metrics.jsonl` for sanitized per-call model-work rows when a
  live Agent SDK, Codex CLI, or Claude Code route exposes compatible usage or
  timing telemetry.
- `provider_request_metrics.jsonl` for opt-in, redacted provider HTTP timing
  rows from live Codex CLI or Claude Code runs when
  `ROBOCLAWS_PROVIDER_TIMING_PROXY=1` is enabled. These rows are transport
  timing evidence, not provider-internal model compute time.
- `roboclaws_report_performance_metrics_v1` packets, usually produced by the
  report-performance extractor, for maintainer comparisons of quality,
  call-count work, model work, normalized-estimate availability, and residual
  latency.
- `cleanup_backend_evidence` inside `run_result.json` for normalized backend
  provenance, runtime-metadata attachment status, diagnostic availability,
  robot evidence, and artifact keys. Backend-specific legacy sections such as
  `molmospaces_runtime` and `isaac_runtime` remain available for specialized
  reports and checkers.
- `runtime_metric_map.json` when a run builds or updates household world
  evidence.
- `runtime_map_prior_snapshot.json` when online runtime-map output or
  offline Agibot navigation memory is packaged for downstream household tasks.
- `report.html` for human review.
- Optional planner-proof bundles when cleanup substeps are checked against
  local RBY1M/CuRobo proof.
- Future eval-suite outputs under `output/evals/<suite>/<stamp>/`, including
  `eval_results.json` and an eval report that links back to underlying product
  run artifacts.

The artifact boundary matters: public agent evidence and private scoring truth
must remain separate. Reports may display both, but agent inputs and MCP
profiles must not leak private evaluator data.

## Real-Robot Boundary

Real-robot work is incremental:

1. Prove public map context and observation.
2. Prove bounded navigation to operator-approved waypoints or backend-verified
   goals.
3. Keep manipulation as `blocked_capability` until physical proof exists.
4. Promote physical manipulation only when reports can show provenance, safety
   gates, and failure modes.

Agibot G2 is the current physical backend variant under the same public
task/profile shape as simulator and digital-twin runs. ROS2/Nav2 remains a
future backend candidate or historical proof path; do not advertise it as an
active launch backend until a catalog route and real operator proof exist.
